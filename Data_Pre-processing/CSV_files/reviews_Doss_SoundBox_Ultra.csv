R2DYCMS5TB4LC1,B0CP7YLJ21,"5.0 out of 5 stars Exceptional sound, reasonable cost",David West,5,"I live fulltime in my rv at the moment with my much loved custom sound system in storage. Over the past 3 years I have tried literally a dozen+ speaker systems trying to max out my acoustics. These are the best by at least 50%! The highs and midst are clear at higher volumes. The only critique I have would be that the bass seems a tad light. It's fine for me but I think younger folk might find the ""thump"" lacking a little. For the money and considering the space that I have to work with I HIGHLY recommend a pair. I intend on adding them to my ""real"" sound system when I get settled again.

R3E8MBK1KJ7D5B,B0CP7YLJ21,5.0 out of 5 stars Very loud if you need it & sounds great.,Jason Raub,5,"I got one on sale & it's pretty nice for a bluetooth speaker.I suggest reading the user manual if you want to access a few unique options, two of which I've not seen on other bluetooth speakers personally, like the ability to turn off all sound prompts while still seeing with an led indicator when you change activate or deactivate an option or feature being one of them.One feature I've also not personally seen on other bluetooth speakers this one includes that's much appreciated, it gives you the ability to disconnect & reconnect to the last device used from the speaker, on top of that when you turn it off then back on it will only connect if you re-enable it from the speaker avoiding audio switching straight from the last device causing problems say if you're on a phone call or anything else you don't want openly broadcast on accident.Only negative thing I can say is it's way too easy to listen to audio at unsafe levels with any high power speakers, including this one, and that's no fault of the speaker it's just something to be aware of. I gave myself a pretty bad headache turning the volume full blast, so I'd suggest enjoying your audio at a safe level & distance because it sounds really good until you hurt your ears or head.This DOSS brand makes some really good smaller bluetooth speakers too if you don't need this much volume, because this thing could seriously make your neighbors angry ha.","Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2024",AH4QFGDUBRCCHURNY5S2Z62EOZXQ,True,10,Color: Gray

R27NSEA4YJAF9R,B0CP7YLJ21,4.0 out of 5 stars DOSS SoundBox Ultra Bluetooth Speaker,MC,4,"Here is a speaker that I like for a couple of reasons.1, is that it has this clean, retro look. You can place it anywhere and it sort of blends in, but yet still adds a little bit of style to any area, and 2, is this clean sound that it produces.I will emphasize that many companies are starting to use the word ""BASS"" in their products description, because they know that it attracts the attention of the buyer. Many time they will over state the products function by using words or phrases such as ""Powerful Bass"", ""Mega Bass"", ""Booming Bass"", or ""Extreme Bass"" and their product will fall short, or may produce muddy sounds and low clarity.In this case, I will say that this speaker has moderate bass, and you will get a nicer and fuller sound it you place it in a corner on an angle, to help with the sound response and bass reflection.It also produces a pretty clean sound. I like to enjoy music when I listen to it and the only way to do that is to have nice mids and very clear highs.“BASS SHOULD BE A COMPLIMENT TO YOUR MUSIC, NOT THE STAR OF IT”!This speaker has very nice sound and style, with a decent compliment of bass. I enjoy it on my weekend mornings, sort of as a calming vibe. The bass is not overpowering, and the songs I play can be heard at an enjoyable clarity. The 80 watts of power is enough to fill the room and allows you to turn it up a bit for others to enjoy with you.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2024",AFEGGRZ2KH5OZPE5ESYHC2Y4USTA,False,1,Color: Gray

It has a cool retro vibe.-It has multiple playback modes besides Bluetooth (USB-A, USB-C, Micro SD, Line In)-It seems to hold a charge for a long time, at least a day's worth of playback-Large button on the top for On/Off, Bluetooth setup, Volume control, Extra bass and few other functions that are listed in the small instruction manual that comes with it-Sound comes out from both the front and backside, so when I use it in my patio area, people sitting ""behind"" the speaker, still get some decent sound-The sound is quite good. I wouldn't expect this to be the highest quality, but it's a great sound for what it is. I'm using this speaker for our guest/office space and the outside patio area near our pool and it looks and sounds just fine. The extra Bass button is a cool feature because when using outdoors, I can minimize the potential disturbance to my neighbors. I try to always be respectful of my neighbors with the music I play outside occasionally.-I cannot comment on the price/value since I have no reference for what this kind of speaker would typically cost, but the quality of this speaker is highOverall, I am happy with this speaker and I recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2024",AEYBGLTDGAW43QHIHPG4EHURZ7BQ,False,2,Color: Gold

R3MIAOES1GMS8H,B0CP7YLJ21,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Nuanced Sound,imsureitsfine,4,"The media could not be loaded. Audio being such a subjective thing is sometimes hard to review. With that in mind, the thing that stuck out to me most when starting to use this speaker was the overall balance and nuance to the sound profile. I've spend my fair share of time with other speakers and I find that they often tend to tune their speakers as very bass heavy to make it feel like that they are more ""powerful"" than some others. The DOSS speaker, while perfectly capable of hitting some good lows, does a great creating an even soundscape and doesn't drown out everything in muddy bass. Out of the box, I find it to be very pleasant across a variety of music genres. There is aIt does get plenty loud, and will easily fill a modest sized room. I haven't specifically timed playtime but I have been able to make it through two days of work and a medium volume without charging. I'm using it primarily via the Bluetooth connection although there is a 3.5mm for direct connection.Construction wise, I think it feels good. Very hefty and not at all hollow feeling. The ""wood on the sides is nice enough visually but the right side of mine it slightly indented for some reason. You can feel it more than you can actually see it. I like the overall minimal look and the button dial up top is functional. To that point, I do wish the volume was more of an analogue dial you could rotate as the volume intervals aren't quite as precise as I would like. You can always use the slider on your device to achieve a more exact level but it would be nice to do this from the device. Also, there is skip or back button. You can pause and play with the larger center button.This also supports linking two units for better separation. I only have one though so I can't comment on how well that works. The BASS-M button seems to increase the low end a bit when you press and hold it. At lower volumes I think it is effective, but when it is louder, I don't think it is necessary.Although DOSS may not be the first speaker brand that comes to mind, I'm quite impressed with their approach to sound. I like the playtime, sound design, minimal look, and mostly good construction. I think their buttons could be better but are serviceable. Given the price (as of this review) of almost $180 I think it might be hard to justify compared to some others on the market. That said, if you listen to one of these, the sound performance might be good enough to make it worthwhile. I'm quite happy with it despite some minor flaws.","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2024",AHNWO5R6A2P4GSRUPEDJMO3XSPRQ,False,6,Color: Gray
RNXZ88CE7BCZX,B0CP7YLJ21,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent sound but was hoping for more bass,ralfwolf,4,"For a speaker of this size and price, I was honestly hoping for bass. Don't get me wrong it sounds good but just doesn't really have a punch. It does play quite loud and overall sound quality is clear and definitely better than the smaller portable speakers I've tested. I found it interesting that this speaker came with a battery given the size. I would have rather given up the battery and given it a larger or extra bass driver or echo chamber to improve low end punch. Unfortunately, as is, it's in an awkward middle spot of ""too big to travel with"" and ""don't want to leave it plugged in because of battery"". I might take this guy outside for an backyard meal and that's about it because I've got other speakers that have good bass and require plug and smaller portable speakers that almost as good but much smaller and much more portable.","Reviewed in the United States April 9, 2024",AFXYUG75FJNUK43VD22FS366H46A,False,0,Color: Gold

R1SR77LKZYKF9I,B0CP7YLJ21,5.0 out of 5 stars Overall great-sounding speaker,Kaz,5,"This speaker was hard to review as it's different from most Bluetooth speakers I've used. The midrange is great, the highs aren't piercingly annoying, and the bass is good for its size.Notes:-All testing using audio being sent via Bluetooth from a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra using Tidal on the highest settings for all tracks.-Best overall sound quality tests were performed at 2/3 volume level via Bluetooth.-This speaker's ""perceived"" sound quality seems to be *very* dependent on the music being played back.Positives:-Loud. More than enough power to fill a large bedroom, living room, etc. You can feel it moving air.-The midrange and highs are really nice and clear, even at higher levels, without being obnoxious like on pretty much every other spearer of this size I've tried.-It handles classical music extremely well, as long as it doesn't dip into the lows very far.-An absolutely fantastic solution for limited space when in need of better sound than what you TV can output.-Connecting via Bluetooth is super easy with everything from Windows, iOS, and Android, I had zero issues.-USB-A port for thumb drives-USB-C rechargeable-Micro SD card slot.-Line in.-Metal speaker mounts.-Single-piece metal front/top/back, good looking wood-grain effect plastic sides.-Simple top buttons are easy to use to control the speaker.-Supports dual-speaker playback, allowing 2 to be paired to the same audio source.Music Tests:-Whilst this speaker does have more bass than similar-sized speakers I have tried, it's nowhere near ""deep"" per the listing.-It cannot, in any way, handle a track like Daft Punk's ""Musique"", the changing/sweeping bass/mid parts in the track, it just gets lost 100% and makes it sound like pure trash at anything but low volume.-Contrasting that, it handles Daft Punk's ""Around the World"" acceptably at about 2/3 volume without running into distortion.-X Ambassador's ""Hold You Down"" loses its very impactful bass, unfortunately, but otherwise still sounds good.-Whilst it doesn't have the hard-hitting bass that's possible, Earth, Wind & Fire's ""Let's Grove"" is reproduced respectfully.-It handles Lindsey Stirling's ""First Light"" and ""Eye of the Untold Her"" extremely well, even cranked up, without distorting. Whilst the bass isn't ""there"" as it would be if these tracks were being pumped through a stereo with large speakers, or even a high-end pair of headphones, the fact is can still sound good playing these tracks is impressive.-Claire de Lune sounds great cranked up about 2/3 of the way, handling the nuances of the piano fine. Anyone else think certain music in the Zelda series of video games reminds you of Claire de Lune, or is that just me??-Cream's ""Sunshine of Your Love"" sounds great, even able to make out the stereo separation of the track extremely well, which is surprising for something this small.Other Audio Tests:-Makes TV shows and YouTube audio sound fantastic as it handles voice extremely well.-As long as you're not playing a game with massive explosions, video games are reproduced great.Considerations:-To get more bass out of the speaker and to project the sound more, place the back close to a solid object/wall or to make it even better, put it in a corner. Doing so can have drastic improvements on the sound.Negatives:-As mentioned above, this speaker can sound amazing, and then like trash, depending on the music it's playing. The best example being the contrast between Daft Punk tracks. The sub just starts rumbling at higher volume, unfortunately.Overall:-I find listening to this speaker to be very pleasant over long periods of time, even at high volume.-This DOSS speaker handles the midrange up highs far, far better than every other Bluetooth speaker I've tested in the sub-$150 range.-Don't get this if you're looking for bass, you *will* be disappointed. At high volumes, the bass goes into muddiness zone or it kinda just stops putting anything out.In Closing:-For the normal 'list price' of $179.99, there are better options available. If you can pick this up for the current $129.99 with the $10 coupon, bringing it down to $119.99, I'd highly recommend it.This review is for ""DOSS SoundBox Ultra Bluetooth Speaker with 2.1 Sound Channel Audio, 80W Superior Sound with Deep Bass, Two DSP Technologies, 18H Playtime, Bluetooth 5.3, Wireless Speaker for Home, Office, Livingroom""","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2024",AE7RH2BM22UZAZTXSJUF2ZGXSKSA,False,2,Color: Gray

The original Soundbox XL came out 7 years ago, so this was a much needed update, the Ultra..This model has a similar build quality and 2.1 layout like the original. This new Ultra opts for a rear ported design instead of sealed with passive radiators. Power has more than doubled from the old model, with the Ultra boasting 80w of power.Like the older model, this new Ultra has no water rating or handle. No HD codecs and no WiFi support. For a home model in 2024, WiFi should have been included to stream your favorite music services.

Battery life seems to last a good time at medium volume. It just seems like this long awaited update to the Soundbox XL is missing some options and features that a home speaker should have in 2024.","Reviewed in the United States March 19, 2024",AH6ZABNUKZ2UMHX4YLFVVJCS5WPQ,False,2,Color: Black

R371WQ6DPA1H8A,B0CP7YLJ21,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good speaker, fills a niche very well",Tee,4,"I love that companies are making ""indoor"" bluetooth speakers that go with decor and prioritize sound and looks vs. how waterproof and how many LED's they can throw on them. This Doss fits that indoor niche and I appreciate what it is. It is a 2.1 speaker in that it has true left/right drivers and a subwoofer built in. The speaker is wide enough and you will hear a bit of stereo separation if positioned in front of it.It also has a 3.5mm jack so you could hook up an external source to it also (Chromecast, CD Player, record player, FM/AM radio, etc). I am glad they included this as it makes the speaker vastly more flexible and not just reliant on bluetooth connections. If you don't have a lot of room this might be a good solution for you if you want a small directly-connected vinyl setup without having to resort to the lossy bluetooth protocol.Sound-wise, it does sound good. Not the best I've heard, but good. It's punchy-ish, it's stereo and it could easily fill a room up. Doss advertises a 35hz bottom end. I played a few test tracks and 60hz and 50hz were very audible, but it started falling off significantly at 40hz. Also, the bass is ""flabby"" on those low notes. I compared to my benchmark favorite sounding bluetooth speaker of all time, the Sony XB43, and the Sony has way tighter and more tuneful/musical bass at those lower frequencies. An EDM speaker the Doss is not.Now, the problem with the $179 price (at the time of this writing) is that there are a lot of good bluetooth speakers in that range and even better bluetooth speakers that are completely separate cabinets so you can spread apart and get a proper stereo image. My Sony XB43 compensates for this with a ""live 3D"" stereo mode, which works well in helping broaden the soundstage. The Doss only has a bass boost (which does indeed boost the bass a touch and I have been running with that ""on"" since I don't listen at high volumes) but nothing more to help the soundstage. The Doss sounds far more ""thin and narrow"" than the Sony XB43 does (perhaps an unfair comparison since MSRP's were different, but the Sony was $199 toward the end of its life).The Doss does have TWS so you could pair two of them for stereo and my guess is that'd likely sound really good. But that's a $360 total investment and there are a lot of really good options in that price range as well. With that said, I likely would not recommend that (for price reasons) unless you really, really like this speaker.I have the ""Gold"" color and it's more of a platinum/champagne color, which I really like. It has a certain retro appeal. However, I am not a huge fan of the faux wood vinyl on the sides (I suppose that's retro too, but not necessarily in a good way), especially at this price point. I'd expect faux woodgrain on a $40 speaker, not a $180 speaker. I could have done without the ""Doss"" logo in the middle of the grill as well; seems like it'd of been more at home in a corner or on the top. Also, I'd have preferred a few knobs on the top vs. the push button interface for everything...every time I want to adjust something I need to get out the manual and look up what to do. Knobs would likely help with that. That's all me nitpicking this though. It does work well as-is and still looks good, all things considered.Overall, I like the niche that this speaker fills and I like the approach they took with it. It definitely sounds very good overall. It's about $180 though, which is not an inexpensive purchase and it has some stiff competition in that price range. If this fits your need, I can certainly recommend it as I think most will like the sound it produces. I really hope the trend continues to offer high-quality speakers, such as this, designed for indoor usage. A black rubber coated large speaker looks completely out-of-place in most dining, living, bed, etc. rooms and the color choices offered on this Doss will blend into most decors with ease.My only issues with the speaker is the somewhat flabby bass below 60hz and the soundstage is narrow compared to class-leaders. The faux woodgrain cheapens the look on the ""Gold"" version as it's made well otherwise with the metal casing.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024",AGOT7D3GZFVAZMP5VJUXVODL3U2A,False,4,Color: Gold

The bluetooth signal is strong and doesn't drop out when I move the speaker. It was very easy to hook up to my computer. The speaker was found and added quickly. No problems at all with that.It charges quickly and holds it for a very long time. I can have it on all day and into the evening and it still shows it has power left. I plug it in to recharge nightly but I could easily go a couple of days playing and not run out of power.It's an attractive speaker that doesn't take up a lot of room. Always good when today we all have so many bluetooth, wireless gadgets that take up our desk space. I'm using this as my primary speaker and did away with my old system of a woofer and two speakers. It sounds better than they did and has the added bonus of being able to grab it and take it anywhere within my home.This speaker is solid and weighty. You'd think it was much more expensive than it is. At this time it's on sale for $129.99 plus an extra $10 off! So not bad at all for what you'll be getting. I'm thinking of buying another to take to another part of my house so I can just use it from there. I recommend this speaker to anyone wanting portable sound or even stationary.

The system I've been using for the last few years sounds great but has a large bass cabinet, two stereo speakers and they are all wired together. Including the cable for the volume control and it's plugged in. This has really turned my desktop into a traffic jam. When I saw the SoundBox and read the specs I saw a possible solution to this situation. And it looks and sounds great. I do have stereo sound. Very clean and crisp highs and warm midtones. The bass was not as boomy as I was expecting but was perfectly balanced with the rest of the sound. My guess is really cranked up the bass would be boomier. This is a great sleek looking unit with a modest footprint. Especially considering the mess it replaced and the actual desktop space freed up. I'm indoors in my office so I've never gotten close to cranking it all the way up. It is clear tho this can definitely rock the house so to speak. And at the loudest I've had it there is no vibration, hiss, nothing but sweet clean sound. The SoundBox is behind my monitor but via bluetooth I can control all the volume from my keyboard. SoundBox will turn itself off if not in use after 15minutes. This is a great looking unit that has made my office a so much nicer place to work and play.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024",AHZVZFBCYKNK3XPPJJIPLVYB6KKQ,False,2,Color: Gray

But I move around too; office, dining room, kitchen, patio, pool, etc. I also have a travel speaker that I have been using; it sounds great “for the size…” But at home, do I really need a travel-size footprint speaker or can I upgrade the sound quality if I upgrade the footprint. Why listen for reduced sound quality when I don’t have the same constraints?And that is where this comes in. I can move to Dining Room, Office, Patio, etc. It is portable. And with it being rechargeable I don’t even need a power outlet. I wouldn’t put this in my suitcase, but I have this covered with my travel speaker. The sound upgrade => totally worth it.As to the claim of 18-hours playtime; I put that to the test. Full charge, I have 18-hours now and the low-charge red LED is still not on. I would caution this means you turn power off when not using; standby keeps it on and looking for a connection and this reduced my playtime to six (6) hours.

However, it offers several drawbacks that are definitely worth considering. At this price point, I believe there are better options available.What's good:• Small form factor, will fit on any counter top or shelf.• Easy pairing - immediately connected with an iPhone, a Mac computer, and an Android phone in my testing.• Reasonably good bass - though it's drastically affectedy by where you place this speaker. For best results, I found putting it on an empty shelf in a bookshelf (so it was in something of an alcove) helped enhance the bass response considerably.• Good battery life. I've listened to this for hours without fully charging it yet. If you need something portable for a party or similar where it'll be on for several hours at a time, this is a good option.What's not good:• Overall sound response. The most important job of any speaker is to reproduce sound as well as possible, and this little speaker needs some improvement. The mids are hollow and echoey, and the highs are so muted/muffled as to make me wonder if there is something actually wrong with it. I compared this head to head with several other small bluetooth speakers I own, and while this one had more bass than the rest, it sounded worse in all other respects compared to them all.• Cheesy plastic fake wood grain. This may look ok from across the room, but up close it's obvious this is in a plastic case. The wood grain looks and feels very fake.• Cheap construction: The whole thing appears to have just been snapped together. I did not take it entirely apart to see exactly how it was assembled, but the fake wood sides clearly just snap into the rest of the case.Overally, this is just ok. It'll fill a good sized living room or kitchen with music/podcasts, and the portability is great.

R235XOT7UUKPLP,B0CP7YLJ21,"5.0 out of 5 stars excellent audio quality, but at a price",Alfred S.,5,"This speaker delivers superior sound, at least to the untrained ears of a mere mortal like me who is not an audio-speaker geek. The bass is rich. The audio is clear. The volume can get quite loud without distortion. It is easy to operate. It functions for well over twelve hours on a full charge. It is so sleek that it is almost invisible on my book shelf. I cannot image a one-piece 13.3"" x 6"" x 4"" indoor speaker sounding better than this one.But it is very expensive. At this price, other products may be preferable, like two- and three-piece speakers that create a true stereo sound.","Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2024",AETDFDC6KFZLAJNXPVWJ5XMFMB5A,False,0,Color: Black
R1MQ8CQHL6QQ2W,B0CP7YLJ21,"3.0 out of 5 stars Oh you beautiful, flawed speaker",Khoi Nguyen,3,"It's a beautiful speaker for those who enjoy the retro aesthetic.But for the steep price of $160, the audio quality on these speakers are 6/10 at best - the bass comes across weak and muddled, the mids and highs are okay, but the volume is very loud! Normally this would make it a 4/5, despite the price, but where I have a problem with is the control itself. I don't care that the buttons are flush, but knobs really would've made this work better, because it's hard to tell what the settings are, as there are no app controls or screen to indicate data.Secondly, the aux port is messed up. I was going crazy trying to get it to work, swapping in multiple aux cables only to find that the device only recognizes the aux setting when it's plugged in 3/4 of the way...and at that point the sound is unrecognizable. Maybe I just got a dud? Either way, poor quality control for a device of this price.Now, if you're only concerned with bluetooth and the aesthetics, then I'd give it a 4.25/5....but overall it's a 3 for me.","Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2024",AFIMYNSWISMQZ23GA74OL623HCUQ,False,0,Color: Gold

It's surprising how loud and clear it sounds for being as small as it is. This actually out-performs my soundbar. You can easily hear this through my whole house with no issues at half volume. If I cranked it up all the way, I'm sure my neighbors could clearly hear it, too.The battery life seems good so far, which is beyond bizarre to me, considering how good the sound quality is. However, with that being said, it is a bit on the pricey side. In my opinion, it's completely worth the money, though.","Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2024",AH557O5Y2DOA5D5DOTVWP4VUPRNQ,False,0,Color: Gold

Early units from years ago had a separate bass box and a tangle of cords. No more; simple Bluetooth hookup.My 79 year old ears have lived through too many rock concerts and I need a mid-range boost. So when I plugged this unit in, the bass was fantastic revelation to hear (and feel) once again...but too much bottom is muddy ...for me. Young ears will love this.I adjusted with the EQ to lower bass a bit, boost the voice bands, and WOW! Now the old feeling was back!This unit has some weight to it, not plasticy feel.

This is the second DOSS SoundBox speaker I've owned and man did they ever up their game!! This speaker is legit. It's got everything you'd expect in a high end speaker with regards to connectivity and options. I'm not technologically advanced myself, but I was able to easily connect it to both my cellphone and my turntable so I'm super happy! It's heavy and bigger than I thought it would be, takes up a bit of space on my TV console, but it's better than my sound bar as far as the sound quality goes. I might just hook my TV up to it instead! Highly recommend this sweet little speaker. Worth the price for the step up in quality.

It sounds so good you will want to rediscover your music collection. Sure, with 80W you can make it loud, but the speakers and enclosure work together to fill the room with music in a way that nearly sounds 3D. They say the speaker will last for 18 hours at half volume. Even at half volume this speaker provides and incredible experience. You don't need to bludgeon your ears with noise.

Crystal clear, perfect bass, and performs like a great sound bar. I connected my tablet and enjoyed a movie with this speaker. The box is made of mostly metal front, back, and top. The sides and bottom a nice light colored wood. It's designed for perfect sound, and that's exactly what you get. The connection to Bluetooth is easy, you can use an SD card, and auxiliary hook up as well. Charges with a type C USB charger wire. Charger box not included.

R3VSPQWFC53BWQ,B0CP7YLJ21,"3.0 out of 5 stars Loud, bass heavy tabletop",E.Swope,3,"I should preference my review by saying that my personal preference is for balanced full range sound, and that I have distinct audiophile leanings. I have tried a number of Doss speakers over the past several years and have, by and large, thought pretty highly of them. Among upcoming brands which produce bass heavy/ extra bass speakers Doss is a standout. Their sound and build quality is generally better than comparably priced speaker in tat space.This speak IS loud, and it has a bass heavy profile even without the bass boost switched on. When I first turned it on the sound was rougher than I expected (knowing the brand) but after and hour or so of burn in it smoothed out quite a lot. Still, this is not what I would call a balanced profile. The pounding bass made REM sound like a dance (club) band. Things which leaned towards folk or jazz just did not sound right. The highs and mids are not so good, and the bass edge just does not work with some music. Again, I am talking about the basic profile with extra bass switched off..I should mention that in terms of features, this speaker has line in, an sd cards slot, and usb for use with flash drives. By contrast, other BT speakers in this price range, and comparably priced tabletop speakers I have tried, have wifi for streaming music. The speaker also lacks lossless blue tooth codecs, also found in speakers in this price range.While I was tempted to rate this 4 stars because of my prior experience with the band, I had my husband (a musician and audio engineer) listen to it and he shrugged and said ""just average"". This is the 4th tabletop I have tried this year. The others were from JBL, Marshall, and Klipsch. Fact is that all of them are better. Normally I would say that's not a fair comparison, but, given that the retail pricing on this speaker and the Klipsch are $20 apart, and that the Klipsch has a dynamic range of 20 hz to 22,000 khz, (This speaker is 35-25) there really is no comparison, except on price. I am not sure if that was the second or third speaker (or set of speakers) I have bought from Klipsch this year... to be honest I do not know what's going on but their speakers are a steal at the present time, while I think this particular Doss speaker is priced out of it's milieau.Others will undoubtedly like this speaker better than I do. If you are looking for something loud, with a bass heavy profile, you will like this speaker better than I. To my mind it performs like one of Doss's outdoor party speakers; only the shape is different.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024",AGASAFHLQKQP7RNG76TKN4GPBJBQ,False,0,Color: Gold
