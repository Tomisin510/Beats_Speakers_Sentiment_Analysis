It's easy to pack and bring with you, making it an essential item during my recent move. The speaker easily connects to my iPhone and plays music and podcasts with ease. Its compact size is convenient but can make it easy to misplace when you're busy moving, so keep it nearby and charged so you can easily find it. Extremely satisfied with the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2024",AHP3MWGHFNQNNNAOQEZKYORO6CXA,True,1,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

R28KFAR0FBMJER,B07DD3WBYW,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound,"Emigdio Hinojosa, Jr.",5,"These UE Boom 3 speakers sound great. They party up feature works flawlessly. Does not take much for them to be loud. Only thing that could be improved is the renaming of the Bluetooth device. When you rename in your Bluetooth settings, that name does not transfer over to the UE App or vice versa. So you have to rename the same device in two different places. Sight inconvenience, but for the sound and quality not worried about it. Would definitely purchase again.","Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2024",AHK76NGFACELYG54U222JYZ637XA,True,2,Color: Lagoon BluePattern: Speaker
R3FXXMYB4LCBKF,B07DD3WBYW,1.0 out of 5 stars The worst speaker every when used as two or more together,Charles Magnuson,1,"The media could not be loaded. I have two opinions of the Ultimate Ears Boom speakers.When used as a single speaker, the Ultimate Ears Boom 3 speaker works well. The sound quality and loudness are good for a speaker of its size. The Bluetooth range is rather pathetic as I lose connection after moving about 20 feet away from the speaker's audio source, but I blame Bluetooth for being a lousy wireless standard more than the speaker for that fault. The speaker can be used every day in the shower with no negative repercussions. Overall, the Boom 3 speaker is a great speaker when used by itself.The situation completely changes when attempting to use two or more Boom speakers together. I'll go into details below, but I can confidently say that I've experienced few pieces of technology that are more unreliable and frustrating than the Boom 3 speakers when trying to get them paired together and playing the same audio.First, the Ultimate Ears Boom app is a huge frustration. Getting even a single speaker to show up in the app can require multiple disconnects, app force quits, and speaker restarts. Once a primary speaker shows up in the UE Boom app, getting other speakers to show up is near impossible. Each and every day I want to use the speakers together, I have to go through a 20-minute process of forgetting Bluetooth settings, repairing, and powering off and on speakers. It is such a frustrating process that I usually rage quit and forgo using the speakers together.Then, once the speakers are connected together they regularly start clicking and thumping as they stutter during audio playback. Even when I move the two speakers within a foot of each other and the audio source, they regularly and constantly stutter and lose bits of audio. Listening to an entire song without missing parts is impossible when using the Ultimate Ears Boom speakers together in Party Up or Two-Up mode.Simply put, THESE SPEAKERS DO NOT WORK WHEN PAIRED TOGETHER. The Boom speakers are completely worthless when used together as the audio they play is unlistenable.I really enjoyed the single Ultimate Ears Boom speaker I used on its own for about two years, but after experiencing the disaster which is Party Up mode and the Ultimate Ears Boom app, I will never again purchase another Ultimate Ears product. This experience has just been too frustrating and I've wasted $300 on two speakers I cannot use together.","Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2018",AFN57XUWIRHZ24FA7IVOW5HXLL2Q,True,284,Color: Sunset RedPattern: Speaker
R3E39REOEKMJHO,B07DD3WBYW,2.0 out of 5 stars DO NOT BUY: Ruined my relationship with ULTIMATE EARS :(,Hailey DeArruda,2,"💗Let me start by saying before buying this product I have been a HUGE, longtime fan of the Ultimate Ears brand.I purchased the original Wonderboom portable bluetooth speaker maybe 5 years ago or longer? I originally purchased it because I wanted something waterproof that I could use in the shower. It was GREAT for that purpose, and also proved to be an awesome all-around portable bluetooth speaker. Sound quality was great for the price range and size. Volume was SUPER as well. I loved the big loop on the back that you could hang on all sorts of things. I LOVE the concept of the Magic Button in the center to Play, Pause & Skip. The Skip Feature is ESPECIALLY hard to find on a speaker in this price range and I love it for use at work when I may not be able to easily access my phone. Bluetooth connection was great. Battery life originally lasted anywhere between 4-6hrs at least which was great. THIS SPEAKER LASTED ME AT LEAST 5 YEARS with little to no change in quality. I LOVED THIS SPEAKER! Unfortunately, I left it at work one week when I was on vacation and just left it there figuring my coworkers could use it and would respect it enough. Long story short, I came back and it wasn't working as well or holding a charge properly. It was a sad end to a good story.🔍Finally, I find myself in need of a new speaker. Because I LOVED my original WONDERBOOM so much, I decided to search within the Ultimate Ears line.((It also just so happens at my current job our department owns two WONDERBOOM2 speakers! I've noticed their battery life doesn't work as well, but they still worked pretty decent.))So I wanted one of the newest, nicest speakers in the Ultimate Family. The Hyperboom was too large to transport from home and work, and cost way more than I was looking to spend, so that was out of the question. So immediately I decided to research between the BOOM3 & the MEGABOOM3. In conclusion, through reviews I read I concluded that most consumers felt the bass was overpowering for the Megaboom3 with no real volume increase, and simply diminished the quality of the sound. SO, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE BOOM3!1️⃣🆕First impression out of the box, it looked nice enough. I preferred the more compact design of the Wonderboom, and DEFINITELY missed the larger, more practical loop. It still has the magic button which is a HUGE selling point to me and very accommodating.I charged it up to 100% and decided to unplug it and test it out for a while at home. It worked well, sounded almost exactly like the Wonderboom as far as sound QUALITY. I might be wrong but as far as VOLUME goes I feel it may have had the same volume limitations as the original Wonderboom, if anything maybe SLIGHTLY louder. However, I was happy it seemed to be fully functioning and worked just as well as my other one.I also liked that in addition to that, I was able to use the Ultimate Ears app in conjunction with the product to REMOTE START the speaker from my phone. Again, this is another HUGE selling point to me because I mainly use this product at work. It also has an EQUALIZER function which is definitely cool, although I don't feel like it's very accurate. It also has some sort of feature where you can set certain clicks on the Magic Button to play certain playlists automatically, which sounds cool although I never got to personally try it.All in all, it seemed like a good replacement at first.⚠️🪫THE NEXT DAY COMES & HERE IS WHERE THE PROBLEMS BEGIN. I come into work with my charger FULLY charged at 100%. I use Remote-Start on the app to turn on the speaker. The Remote-Start feature also displays the approximate battery percentage (by 10% increments) of the speaker. At this point, my speaker was at 100% charge.I used the speaker for between 1.5hrs<2hrs before it gave me the Low Battery warning for 10%. So, I put it on the charger and continued to let it play. It lasted maybe another 20minutes, before it died.Now this is VERY disappointing considering my ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM that came out 5+ years ago would last for 4-6hrs on FULL VOLUME without being on a charger. Not only that, but the ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM would ALSO last for a WHILE on the charger even when battery wasn't full.This was disappointing, but didn't seem like a crisis, just a bit sad.The next day, is when the BIGGER issue began. I admittedly forgot to charge my BOOM3 when I got home the night before, and then brought it to work. When I wake up, I charge it until I leave for 1.5HOURS!When I arrive at work, I charge it for an additional 1HOUR before, checking the battery percentage on the app which reads 60%. So, I decide to turn it on and use it while STILL LEAVING IT ON THE CHARGER. NOT EVEN 30 MINUTES GO BY UNTIL THE SPEAKER DIES!!!!!!!!! So, irritated I turn it off, opt for my AirPods and leave the speaker to charge for a few hours. I let this SPEAKER CHARGE FOR 4 MORE HOURS BEFORE USING IT. Finally, I check the battery on the app which only says 40%????? So I turn on the speaker and leave it plugged in, IT LASTS FOR LESS THAN ONE SONG BEFORE DYING!LET ME TELL YOU, THIS SPEAKER BROUGHT OUT PURE RAGE IN ME AT WORK. 🪫⚠️😡I feel so pissed, and cheated and ripped off. I was such a big fan and advocate for the Ultimate Ears brand, but how are you gonna sell me a NEWER, MORE EXPENSIVE speaker and MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY worse. Considering this is the BOOM3, I WOULD HOPE & ASSUME IT IS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL WONDEBOOM FROM 5 YEARS AGO, BUT I GUESS NOT. Thanks, Logitech, just charge me more money for a FAR INFERIOR PRODUCT, with the illusion that is going to be somewhat improved. However; this speaker is simply, for my needs- UNUSABLE & FRUSTRATING!!! HUUUUUGE DOWNGRADE 👎😢Very, very disappointed in the Ultimate Ears brand for putting out this one. Like I sad it really is a shame because I was a HUGE supporter of their brand and unfortunately this product was so disappointing and frustrating that it has ruined my relationship with this company for good.I loved the convenience of the Magic Button with the Skip Feature, the portability, durability, great waterproof technology, super big, useful loop, the sound quality & volume, and the battery life of ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM, but this product has ruined all that unfortunately.⚠️DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SAVE YOUR MOMEY 💸 BECAUSEYOU WILL NEED TO RETURN IT & REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER SPEAKER!!!!!!! THIS SPEAKER IS NOT FUNCTIONAL! ⚠️Sorry, Ultimate Ears, but do better.","Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2022",AFSWDPDFGUZCY4TIBMKU2QD3275A,True,148,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

R1XX4TUH1QR3UL,B07DD3WBYW,"4.0 out of 5 stars Buena calidad de sonido, pero...",Jorge Sarmiento,4,"Llevo tres meses utilizando el BOOM 3 y me parece pertinente hablar de sus características. Empecemos por las cosas buenas:1. CALIDAD DE SONIDOEs necesario resaltar la calidad tan excelsa de sonido que tiene este parlante. Los entendidos sabemos que la conexión por Bluetooth acarrea pérdida considerable en la calidad del sonido. Sin embargo, he de decir que el BOOM 3 me sorprendió sobremanera: agudos y medios en su punto y los bajos, aunque poco notorios y exagerados, son cómodos y audibles.2. VOLUMEN Y POTENCIAEl BOOM 3 es ideal para aquellos que quieran utilizarlo en una habitación pequeña o en una reunión o fiesta. Esto es así porque puede llegar a ser discreto y a la vez muy potente sin llegar a afectar demasiado la calidad de sonido.3. WATERPROOFNo he testeado el parlante sumergiéndolo de lleno en agua, pero se ha llegado a mojar levemente y hasta el momento no ha presentado problemas.Llegó la hora de hablar de lo malo:1. CARGA Y BATERÍASi bien es cierto que la duración de la batería no es el fuerte de este aparato, uno esperaría más por algo que cuesta más de cien dólares. Hay aparatos muchísimo más económicos que tienen una carga más duradera independientemente del uso. Si usas el BOOM 3 discretamente, la batería puede durar más de 10 horas non-stop. Pero si usas el BOOM 3 con el volumen máximo, la carga solo te va a durar cuatro o cinco horas (a menos que lo uses mientras esté conectado a la energía). Se entiende que se hayan decantado por un uso más discreto y se hayan enfocado en un parlante que provea una calidad de sonido óptima, pero repito: este parlante cuesta más de cien dólares y me parece que la batería quedó a deber.2. BUGS Y FUNCIONALIDADES INÚTILESEl botón Magic está muy bien pero tiene muchos defectos. Por ejemplo, no reconoce si laa playlists que añadas están en aleatorio y las termina reproduciendo por default. El conectar dos parlantes con la app me parece genial pero dudo mucho que alguien lo vaya a usar del todo. Con la app de Ultimate Ears no siempre puedes conectarte al aparato y en esos casos debes encenderlo manualmente. Hubo una vez que el aparato no respondía a la conexión y, debido a que la caja no incluye un manual de instrucciones, tuve que buscar en internet para ver cómo lo reseteaba por defecto.Resumiendo:Buena calidad de sonido, buena potencia y buena resistencia al agua. Mala distribución de la carga y mal sistema de conexión.¿Vale la pena comprarlo? Depende de cómo lo quieras usar. Si pretendes usar un parlante para un uso más doméstico y disfrutar de la música en una calidad de sonido decente, este es tu producto. Pero si quieres algo más profesional o externo, puedes conseguir algo mejor.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2023",AE55TVZYQ4SFDSGABXMU7JPEDKFA,True,14,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

R10AD2QSAZA36K,B07DD3WBYW,4.0 out of 5 stars Preferred this over Bose and JBL speakers,Tyler Cash,4,"I went to a Best Buy to look at portable bluetooth speakers. I was able to compare bluetooth speakers from Bose, JBL, and Ultimate Ears. Of all the speakers I listened to at this size and price point, this had the best sound. Best Buy didn't have any BOOM 3 speakers in stock, so I ordered from Amazon. Its been a definite upgrade from my previous similarly sized portable bluetooth speaker, with stronger bass hits and bigger sound overall. The bigger (and more expensive) speakers I listened to sounded better for sure, but the BOOM 3 does great for a more affordable speaker of its size.Its no audiophile speaker. It's tuned for popular music, with particular emphasis on bass and percussive hits. Which is fine, since that's what I was looking for and expecting from a speaker of this size and price. It does a decent job with today's top-40 style music. I don't listen to much rap or R&B, but I think it would do great with those genres as well. Music like Olivia Rodriguez's ""Good 4 U"" was pretty satisfying to listen to. Ultimate ears even provides an app where you can EQ the sound to something that you personally like even better.Music like ""Tightrope"" from the Greatest Showman soundtrack or ""Zanarkand"" from Final Fantasy Distant Worlds was a different story. They sounded muddy and lacked detail in a very unsatisfying way. I don't thing the EQ app can do anything to help that out. You'll want a different speaker if you're looking for a speaker for vocal, orchestral, jazz, etc.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2022",AFHDPQ3WBQQMUQNB46TWQCOSHXPQ,True,21,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

When it wouldn’t take a charge anymore I looked to upgrade. My bf wanted one too because he was so impressed with my old one.So we upgraded to the boom 3, got 2. One was perfect the other didn’t charge. Such easy replacement from Amazon, got it the next day. This one is perfect. You can pair them together to get stereo sound. The sound is phenomenal, pairing is so simple. One of the best speakers out there. I have chosen it over Bose everyday, and I am a Bose girl.If you want immense sound and need it to be easy get any of the wonderboom products.The app is new to me and I need to work with it but I use my Amazon music on it and just party like it’s 1999 in my bathroom getting ready for work.Get the warranty, which I didn’t but should have because when it decides to not charge you will be sad and anxious for a new one. I have had my 1st one for 5 years, I dropped it, regularly and no problems. I use it in the bathroom next to the sink because it is waterproof.The charging dock I haven’t seen it really charge yet, but I could be doing it wrong. But the cord is easy peasy.I love my boom 3 and will stick with Ultimate ears for years to come. You can pair I think up to 20 with the boom 3.

The inconsistent quality is frustrating and I will be looking for a different speaker now.I originally bought one in 2020 and it lasted me 3 years of almost daily use until it started cutting in and out. It would play music and then briefly cut out and back in (like a hiccup) every few minutes. I found it pretty annoying so I ordered a new one. This one was even worse as it started cutting in and out like the last one, but after only 3 weeks of use. I initiated a return, and hopefully I can get it because I threw the box away after I opened it. After 2 of the same speaker, I would say I don't really recommend this one because while my first one did last me 3 years and was great, it seems that the quality of them is inconsistent, so I will be looking for a different one soon.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2024",AE2V2FGKUSXIKL3U3IWWW4L42IKA,True,3,Color: Lagoon BluePattern: Speaker

R200IE3MUNI9EU,B07DD3WBYW,5.0 out of 5 stars good size + sound quality,Omar Siddique,5,"Nice clear mids & decent bass, in an attractive device, make this an all-around winner.On the negative side: there's a mostly unnecessary app, oversized volume buttons, and a I'd prefer it had a USB-C power connector instead of the old ""micro"" connector.Over all, this is a great speaker. It also looks really nice, and feels solid in-hand. The UE is small/light enough that I use it as my travel speaker, although I prefer the boom-ier bass on my (heavier) JBL for workout and party music at home.This speaker sounds good, but not obtrusive-- natural for various genres. The default tuning is ""fine"". Unusual for a Bluetooth speaker, there is an EQ feature on the app, but it doesn't let you turn one band up without decreasing the others. Good for tuning the sound quality for eg, spoken podcasts, but you can't turn up the bass or the treble like you might on a usual sound system.The app also allows using the speaker's top ""smart"" button to automatically launch playlists without otherwise interacting with a device. A clever idea, but since I usually use an AI (like Google Assistant) I find it unnnecessary, and better to not have too many random apps installed. The speaker works beautifully without the app-- totally optional.I used to buy Logitech PC speakers long ago, and they still make good ""gaming"" speakers. It's interesting Logi acquired Ultimate Ears, a brand I hadn't heard of before. A good move on their part, as this is one of the two best speakers I tested recently in my search for the perfect hardware.Highly Recommended.","Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2020",AGMITI35DNIHMTUWA6JSEYH43FGQ,True,9,Color: Sunset RedPattern: Speaker

R1KELUR90PO5A3,B07DD3WBYW,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little speaker,Labcoated,5,"I've been putting this speaker through its paces for the last few hours and I'm really impressed. Sound quality, water resistance, and build quality is all there. The app is well designed, pairing is quick and easy, and bluetooth range covers my entire apartment.It's important to understand that you're not gonna get crazy sub bass on this thing, but that's not what they're trying to do here. One thing I really have to hand it to UE for on this speaker is instead of trying to reproduce frequencies in those bottom sub ranges, they have obviously set a hard shelf on the EQ that totally eliminates those frequencies from the mix rather than try to make the small speakers in this unit try for it anyway. A lot of other bluetooth speakers I've heard fail pretty hard at that and you end up with distortion and a lot of muddiness in the low range because of it. The tradeoff is that especially low end music (namely drum and bass, dubstep, 808 heavy hip hop and trap, etc) isn't going to exactly shine on this speaker.What does sound great, though, is just about everything else that doesn't rely on sub bass. Rock, jazz, metal, most hip hop, most electronic, funk, r&b, podcasts, etc all sound really clear and have great dynamics. This speaker is also capable of going extremely loud. I couldn't get it past around 70% volume in my apartment without it being excessive, yet the music sounded totally clear and free of distortion even when I cranked it.Also, I brought it in the shower to test and it got wet without issue and dried off quickly.I just got the speaker so time will tell how reliable it is, but count me as impressed. I'm looking forward to taking this on river floats next summer. Really happy that well made, waterproof electronics are readily available now. That was by far one of the biggest selling points to me after the sound quality.They should have used USB C, that's maybe my biggest gripe, I've never cared for micro USB.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2018",AGVINZPVX6XN7HFBN4XKCKCLOOCA,True,49,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

The sound was good and so was the Bluetooth range and the battery life is really good. It has notification sounds that play really loud but you can turn them off so that's not a big deal until you can't turn them off, or the speaker.6 months in the ""magic"" button got stuck. It was always a little touchy but it worked and I never paid it any mind but once it got stuck, none of the other buttons worked anymore. The volume and power buttons no longer responded because the magic button was constantly being pressed. There is an app and I could turn the power off that way but minutes later the power was back on because the magic button was depressed. It took days for the battery to run down and at certain intervals it would announce that some feature was not available and to check the aps internet connection, really loudly. When the battery finally ran down it started screaming that the battery was low every 30 seconds. i had to stash it out in the garage.I contacted support and they got back to me saying the warranty doesn't cover the stuck magic button because it was damaged, the kicker is I never said the speaker was damaged, only that the button was stuck.Since it was no longer covered I found a tutorial on how to take it apart and found that the screws that hold the switch in place were so tight that the switch didn't have room to release. I loosened the screws and the speaker is back to working like it should except it's no longer waterproof. That sounds like a manufacturing defect to me. I let Logitech support know what I found and we'll see what they have to say.I would have given the speaker 5 stars but the business with support knocks it down a couple notches in my opinion.","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2020",AHRLZLHRJOA3UFOB2ZV5EEI2EO2A,True,2,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

Well the new speaker gets very crackly and the speaker can't be further than 20' away from each other or they don't work... I can hear the first speaker perfectly fine at 20'. Kind of defeats the purpose of they must be so close to each other,"Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2024",AFQUZIYYW25XONVF5V6GE32MESCA,True,1,Color: Lagoon BluePattern: Speaker
R3J4QOLCB7IAEK,B07DD3WBYW,5.0 out of 5 stars Love it!,OneEyedGupy,5,"For my purposes, this is perfect!This stays in my car for kayaking, sometimes biking when in a group, party's, golfing, working in the garage......you get it.Things I love: the size, the battery (usb C would have been greatly appreciated!), the controls, yes, it really floats (but the speaker is under water while it does, not really usable in a pool or spa) and it seems to be built VERY solid.The sound is a little better than average, and that's comparing it to my best sounding Sony and a very nice Bose that both stay in or close to the house. I'm not a snob when it comes to portable speakers, great sound is achieved under controlled circumstances with much better equipment, this is good for what it is!The app is nice, but doesn't add a lot for me, I can get most of the functions it provides elsewhere, except for the battery level, nice to check before heading out for a day or weekend.The only small flaw I've found to date is the lack of being able to answer a phone call with it. I'm torn on how important of a feature that really is, but it feels like they could have added it and still kept their minimal, clean, very simple controls in tact.I'm very happy with this speaker and it's sort of become my go-to, it's beating out a number of very nice options!","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2019",AEFX2A4BHG3TUNVA5QUDPFTZB77Q,True,8,Color: Lagoon BluePattern: Speaker

RDTJ4OJICTP06,B07DD3WBYW,"2.0 out of 5 stars Stopped charging after a month, good sound, bad bluetooth, awkward charge cord",Ammon,2,"The sound was good while it lasted. Issues that may concern potential buyers: 1. My Boom3 stopped charging after about a month. It doesn't come with a power adapter. Their instructions and FAQ say to charge using any USB power adapter. I charged it using a surge protector with built-in USB ports. The tiny white charging indicator light has stopped lighting up. The device can recognize that it's plugged into an outlet, but it won't charge. I can't use the speaker anymore, and when I try to turn it on the voice just says, ""Charging, please wait."" I've tried other plugs and cords, but no luck. I'm just outside the Amazon return window (sucks because I want a refund) so I'll have to check if the company will exchange or credit it under warranty. 2. Was hoping to use it with my PC, but audio keeps cutting out even though speaker is right next to the case. I tried the troubleshooting tips in their FAQ multiple times, followed other user threads and tips, but never got it working well. All other bluetooth products I have (including noise cancelling headphones and testing it with my spouse's JBL speaker) worked fine. I even unpaired and ""forgot"" everything, then reconnected only the the Boom3... still cutting out at regular intervals. This is a pre-built gaming PC and only a few years old, so I really don't think it's the PC's fault. I found numerous people online with similar issues. 3. The cord that comes with this for charging is disappointing. It is micro USB, which means it is awkward to insert. Why not use USB-C on a newer product like this? The cord is solid white, so it looks garish plugged into my black Boom 3. Also, the plug housing is a big square, but the Boom3 charge slot is inside an oval recess - it's very snug and awkward to plug in. Finally, the cord is a flat/ribbon style - it does not want to go where you want it to go.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2022",AF2JAXPNOHN4CQ523YQQWVNAZ5VA,True,2,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker
R3GXR617W5CHU8,B07DD3WBYW,"4.0 out of 5 stars Pairs easily, magic button is handy",David S.,4,"At first, the Boom 3 didn't turn on for more than five seconds. I was just about to return until a Amazon video suggested resetting the device. I believe it was ""push the volume minus button and the power button at the same time."" That did the trick. I installed the phone app and chose the ""more bass"" selection on one of the automatic equalizer selections. The equalizer produced much improved sound quality in my opinion. I got this to pair with my TV, and all I have to do to pair it up after the initial pairing is to push the magic button and it responds instantly. Good product, weather resistant.","Reviewed in the United States October 8, 2022",AHA3EXTPUSK2UMNONPCSYCLWVAZQ,True,9,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

RIM63S708LP9L,B07DD3WBYW,3.0 out of 5 stars Not what they used to be,Ivan T,3,"What happened to UE? They used to have great bluetooth speakers. I just read that they were bought by Altec Lansing which explains the drop in sound quality. I owned a UE Boom 1st model and 2nd model and they were amazing. So of course I would buy this model the 3rd gen. Well I was disappointed. First it is not LOUD like the previous models. Bass is sub par but then again UE wasnt really know for heavy bass. So first, I tried the volume at Max outside to see how it was. It was decent but not loud like the other gens. 2nd issue is u will need to download their app to get the most of the speaker but even the app provides minimal improvements. Battery life is better I will say but aound just isnt what it used to be. I would send it back but I gave away my other 2 gens to friends when I ordered this. Do yourself a favor. Buy a bose link instead because this doesnt do it. And the 360 immersive sound that it claims is definitely missing. Disappointed in this speaker to say the least.","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2022",AHDRTT26OA2NWGHZIQ4XNIKAJDRA,True,6,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker
R35NBQEDPO572,B07DD3WBYW,2.0 out of 5 stars Bluetooth connection continues to randomly cut out.,RSTILL,2,"Bluetooth connection to my Boom 3 speakers is sub-par and unacceptable for something in this price range. I own two identical speakers which were bought at separate times and have the issue with both.The problem is that the Bluetooth connection randomly cuts in & out, similar to a popping. Happening in different environments, with different transmitting devices and also in daisy chain connections which is so bad that I can not use multiple speakers together. The problem is not consistent, I have checked the firmware level in the Boom app and it shows it is up to date. My two speakers experience the issue at all distances from the phone which range from sitting on the device, next to the device and then any distance range until it's to far to maintain connection.The issue comes and goes and has been happening more lately which is driving my dissatisfaction and this review. I really wanted this to be a good purchase so have given multiple chances for them to work at an acceptable level.I do not recommend the Boom 3 to anyone unless you get a serious discount and do not expect consistent sound. I'll definitely try another brand when I get so fed up with these that I just donate them away.Side note, it seems like BT can be spiritic on other speakers too so perhaps it's worth it to just get a speaker that offers a hard connection to avoid the frustrating situations when you want consistent sound over portability.","Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2023",AHDQACXK3VYQ6HYHHKFU3PNQSJBQ,True,0,Color: Ultraviolet PurplePattern: Speaker
R2743WGOYTFFJR,B07DD3WBYW,3.0 out of 5 stars Good until not!,Fred Frazier,3,"Wanted to give high mark 5stars, but unit stop charging after only 3mo. I'm currently going through warranty process with UE now. Went to Amazon with my problem, & they handed me over to UE. After several attempts to do what UE wanted me to do ie Troubleshooting. Now had to take pictures of unit, pdf format order from Amazon. 14 emails back & forth with UE, hopefully they will get back to me with good news. More to come, all in all the UE speakers have great sound.Update, UE finally shipped out a replacement speaker. 1st person from UE dropped the ball, with all the emails back and forth.2nd person from UE handled the situation more swiftly. Got my replacement speaker in less than 4 days after speaking with 2nd rep from UE.All good no problems with replacement speaker.However, I think that some items should be brought from the manufacturer & not here.. I have another UE speaker from Amazon & the battery dies so fast. The speaker isn't even a year old.So moving forward, I will buy with more caution..","Reviewed in the United States October 27, 2022",AEGIBVJ2KHWUMBO7MQHWL6AJBNJA,True,1,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker
