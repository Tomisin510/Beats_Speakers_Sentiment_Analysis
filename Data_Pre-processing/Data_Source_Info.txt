Q1: Did you have any missing values in your dataset? How did you handle them? Q2: Did you have any outliers in your dataset? How did you handle them? Q3: Why do we convert categorical columns to numerical variables in data cleaning? What is the difference between a nominal variable and an ordinal variable?








1. Change df_filled.is_verified to binary
2. Extract colors from product attributes
3. Extract date & time from timestamp




Conversion: Converting categorical to numerical variables is necessary for most machine learning algorithms, as they require numerical input. Techniques for conversion include:


Label Encoding: Assigning each unique category a numerical value.
One-Hot Encoding: Creating binary columns for each category, indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of each category.


Difference:
Nominal Variables: These are categorical variables with no inherent order. Examples include colors (red, blue, green) or types of fruit (apple, banana, orange). In nominal variables, the categories are distinct and do not imply any ranking.


Ordinal Variables: These categorical variables have a clear order or ranking but do not have a uniform scale. Examples include ratings (e.g., poor, fair, good, excellent) or survey responses (e.g., strongly disagree to strongly agree). The order matters, but the intervals between the values are not necessarily equal.
Understanding these distinctions is crucial for effective data analysis and feature engineering
