Sound quality is great, bass is good, and it’s super rugged and can hold up to drops, dropping in water or splashing, and even dirt and sand! The battery also lasts a long time and the speaker gets super loud, like this thing sounds better than my tvs built in speakers. My only complaints are that the eq isn’t super adjustable with only 3 levels for bass mids and treble. I wish there was at least a little loop or something built in to carry it too, and I wish the usb a port in the back was usb c. I also wish the usb c port was recessed with the other usb port and covered by the rubber flap so that sand or dirt wouldn’t get in it. Other than that, there’s really nothing else I could ask for in a speaker. If you’re looking for a Bluetooth speaker that’s super loud and high quality but still portable and pretty light I would definitely get the charge 5.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States October 9, 2023","profile_id":"AFCP2GGO7ZLOEYFBX65OCZOZPNCA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":2,"product_attributes":"Style: Charge 5 + Divvi CaseColor: Squad"},{"id":"R92OHDD2YZASG","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars I’m impressed","author":"Dennis McElroy","rating":5,"content":"I bought this with a singular purpose in mind.

Both speakers can be joined in party mode (not stereo) with a simple press of the party mode button. JBLs easily connect, and stay connected, to Bluetooth. I still might get another Flip 6 (for stereo) on Prime day.The included case is great protection for traveling. Fits speaker well and has separate compartment for USB cable.

I have been using Flip 5s for a while. Individually, those are great. But PartyBoost just doesn't work properly. Pops and thuds. Sound dropping completely. I'm no audiophile, and I honestly can't tell all that much of a difference in sound quality between the Charge 5 and the Flip 5, but I can say that I listened to music all day long using the Charge 5 as the base speaker for PartyBoost and had 0 issues with all the headaches that the Flips have been giving me.Basically, if you like the Flip, this has a bigger battery, marginally better sound, better IPX rating, and can be used to charge your phone in an pinch. It also uses Bluetooth 5 instead of the Flip's Bluetooth 4.2, which is probably a good chunk of the reason PartyBoost works better.Still no aux in, which is a mild bummer, but not a deal breaker. (The only thing I 'need' aux in for is currently using my Boombox 2, which conveniently has one!) No voice chat, which is a complete non-issue for me, but seems to be a pain point for a lot of folks.The case is nice, but I don't see myself needing it all that much for travel. I saw multiple people complaining about the speaker not fitting while others had no issue. I am fairly certain it is entirely related to what orientation you put the speaker in the case. Put it in the right way and it zips up no issue!Note: The Charge 5 does NOT come with a wall wart. You still get a USB A to USB C connector to charge it with, but you'll need to use an existing wall wart you already own. (I have seen complaints about this as well. But I have like 7 of them plugged in and another 10 or so sitting around as spares.)","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2021","profile_id":"AE7N2ACQHBB3J4PPIM7D3DXGRKXQ","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":26,"product_attributes":"Style: Charge 5 + Divvi CaseColor: Blue"},{"id":"R29ZSFNMA31YF7","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars So far so good.","author":"Rob Buck","rating":5,"content":"I would usually wait a bit longer to post a review but Amazon keeps asking me to post one.

Base good. Support bad.","author":"Bruce J.","rating":3,"content":"The party boost works good. But trying to go in the stereo mode is very time-consuming. My Charge 4 goes in the stereo very quickly. These Charge 5 is haphazard and confusing. I could get it in stereo mode but it would take me 3 to 4 minutes going back-and-forth and back-and-forth until it went in to stereo mode. I called Support and the gentleman knew less than me about it. When I told him my problem, he would repeat it back incorrectly. I explained the problem again and he repeated it back incorrectly. After the third time, he did repeat it back correctly, but then said he would be back which I assuming he was googling how to do it. After dealing him for about 10 minutes, I finally gave up and told him it would be great if the JBL support team knew a little bit about their products. I can get them in the stereo mode now, but it still takes several minutes for it to go into that mode Which is nothing like the charge 4. I’d probably give the sound a 4 and the support a 0 so I guess since it’s a speaker and the sound is most important and it basically almost does what I needed it to, (but it just takes a while) i’ll round it two or 3.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024","profile_id":"AGNCY44CFNRQOM5ISWOXYQU7SOUA","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Style: Charge 5 + Divvi CaseColor: Gray"}],"page_type":"Question","asin_in_url":"B08ZNXW53L","product_name":"JBL Charge 5 Portable Waterproof Wireless Bluetooth Speaker Bundle with divvi!

The unit is VERY solidly built, and while we haven't dropped it into the pool (yet) it does appear to be able to handle a lot of wetness.It was absurdly simple to set up, and we were playing music within 5 minutes of opening the box (the speaker held about 50% charge when it arrived).

This is a speaker you might choose to use at home but it's \"purpose\" is to bring to an event where people want to make some noise and no \"noise making\" appliances are present. It allows everyone with a smart phone to play their favorite artist or mix and is loud enough to fill a room. Neither the dynamic range (noticable roll off on the deep bass end and a tweeter that is harsh until it breaks in and still sounds better from a distance) nor the accuracy are anything to write home about but that's really not the point. The point is to have fun, make noise and enjoy yourself. This speaker gets it done.One note, the Charge 5 is a bit \"kidney\" shaped vs the Charge 4. The supplied case that you get (for free) fits the Charge 5 much better if you turn it upside down with the \"foot\" facing up. The case provides a spot for the charging cable and a (user supplied) charging block. The device is already pretty rugged so it doesn't really need additional protection.

The lettering, fortunately, came off with the protective sticker lol. The charge 5 is bigger, has better battery life and I think it sounds better.
