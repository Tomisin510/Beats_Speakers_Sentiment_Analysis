R36E6CRFVVROEG,B086D4JNGM,5.0 out of 5 stars SRS-XB33 vs Charge 4 (and also a few cheaper models),Allan R,5,"So I've been looking for my do-it-all BT speaker for a while, without spending too much, and of the ones I have owned, the Sony SRS-XB33 is the clear winner. Scroll down if you want to read the direct review of the Sony speaker. Previously, I've owned the Oontz Angle 3 Ultra, and briefly the Tribit Maxsound Plus, and JBL Charge 4. The Oontz speakers I still own, (two in paired stero), and they are a great value for the money, especially as a pair in stereo. That would be a clear winner for me for under $100 (for both!) However, as you might imagine, the small size and overall build prevents this from really producing deep, resonating bass, and the overall sound is a little thin without a ton of range. However, for a lot of people, these would be a perfectly acceptable choice for on-the-go music.The Tribit Maxsound was just not very good. I don't know how it seems to receive such high praise as an affordable, but great sounding speaker. It just isn't very good, very tinny, and the bass is really lacking. The Oontz speakers are a much better sound profile, and even slightly better bass. That model also cannot be paired in stereo (AFAIK). Not worth purchasing IMO.Now, for the XB33, and how it compared to a worthy competitor, the JBL Charge 4. The two speakers are of similar size (I didn't get exact measurements, but are more or less similar), and larger than I might have though. Perhaps because I was used to much smaller, cheaper BT speakers... These are definitely not as portable, at least for things like packing in luggage. Probably fine for road trips, but I would not want to pack this in my airplane luggage. In the box comes the speaker, a charging cord and some (terrible) instructions. The instructions now look like IKEA assembly instructions, just confusing pictures. The pairing process is pretty easy.SOUND: The sound quality of this speaker is outstanding. The overall sound profile is very rich, and it seems to carry farther than the volume would indicate. Meaning, some speakers are loud, but when you walk further away from it, the sound dissipates quickly. The Sony speaker's sound carries farther, I don't know why that is, or how that is quantified, other than when I walk away from it, the volume I hear decreases much more slowly than some other speakers I've had. Again, that's one of those possibly subjective things, but it's definitely true based on my experience. The bass is very robust and resonates well without simply thumping for the sake of being the deepest, hardest bass. The Charge 4 has deeper bass that hits harder, but this one just sounds better. It complements the mids and highs much better than the Charge 4. Speaking of which, the main issue I had with that speaker is the lack of clarity in the mid range. The profile was just too one-dimensional for me. Thumpy bass and decent highs, but there was no depth to the sound. I just could not get into the sound profile from that speaker. You'll see a common complaint about the Charge 4 is the mids, and it absolutely is true. A good speaker with very good bass, but no depth and dimension to it. Back to this speaker, the overall sound profile is the key point. The bass is very good, but the speaker isn't just a slapper. The mids and highs are all excellently rendered in a very three dimensional sound that works well together. There isn't one aspect of this speaker that is ""the best"", but as a total package, it's the best sound I've heard from speakers in and around this price point. Recently I purchased a second to pair in stereo, and I'm even more impressed now. One speaker by itself sounds so rich that you may not need a second, but you really can hear the difference in two of them. Hands down, this is the winner vs the Charge 4, and an excellent value in this price range. Oh, I forgot to mention the lights! They are customizeable in the app, and really add some additional flare to a great sounding speaker, for those big house parties.A few minor complaints I have. One is the volume of this speaker is surprisingly low. I have sensitive hearing, so I generally don't need extreme volume, but I find myself usually at about 80-90% volume outside, and maybe 70% inside, and that's just to listen at a decently loud, but comfortable volume. If you turn it all the way up, it's loud, but I could easily leave it turned up all the way without feeling like my ears would start bleeding immediately. Even my small Oontz speakers can get louder. Again, as a stereo pair, the overall volume is much louder, and that might be a solution, but as a solo speaker, some people might find the volume a bit low. Also, the battery life is pretty poor. Maybe I'm not used to these larger speakers, but I find myself charging the thing every few days, using it several hours a day. It is probably within spec, but it sure does seem like these need to be charged quite often. However, apart from that, this speaker is fantastic, and highly recommended.","Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2020",AE337MXGVFISTCBIEDVVWGUFS2IQ,True,123,Color: Blue

It is loud (when needed), bass is surprisingly strong, and the battery life is very impressive.When (or if?) this speaker ever dies I’ll be ordering the same one without hesitation!","Reviewed in the United States April 28, 2024",AEE3BWRTWIAESXDQKDRWNSLKF7SQ,True,2,Color: Black
R362ZP81YD83WL,B086D4JNGM,5.0 out of 5 stars Performs as Expected,Dave in VA,5,"Very good sound quality for a small portable speaker. Blue Tooth easily pairs with iPhone, Android, and Amazon Echo. Volume adjusts well in very small increments from very quiet to loud. I have not turned it to full volume yet, so I don't know how loud it can get or how much distortion there may be at full volume, but at reasonable levels, I did not detect any distortion. In a large room, 18'X30', with vaulted ceiling, it was still loud even at just a mid-range volume. I do not use the lighting system in it, I found that useless - I wanted a speaker, not a light show.I have been using the device for almost one month on a regular, almost daily, basis, paired to phones and to an Amazon Echo - far superior sound quality to any of those. Used it once on battery mode for several or more hours at a moderate volume without it going dead or noticing any other issues. When it is in battery mode, it turns off after awhile. Left connected to charging cable, it auto-connects with BT device, no manual switching needed.Took on a vacation, put it in the laptop backpack with two laptops, etc., it's light enough and small enough that weight and size is not an issue.So far I am satisfied with how well it performs. I have another portable speaker I bought about 5 years ago for a similar price that is much smaller. I thought that one was pretty good, this Sony blows that one away. This one also pairs more readily and the sound volume, unlike the last one, can be adjusted in small increments.","Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2021",AGTPLWFF7BBIYTFEPFINH6VCANJA,True,1,Color: Black
RT4S0NBB1JFT6,B086D4JNGM,4.0 out of 5 stars Wow! Very slept on!,G-$,4,"Usually I'd buy personal audio from a manufacturer who specializes in speakers, like JBL, Beats by Dre or Sennheiser. But after purchasing some XB50AP earbuds, listening to some XB950N1 headphones, as well as my hearing my brother's SRS-XB31 Bluetooth speaker, I figured there was something to this XB (XTRA BASS) thing that Sony has. The SRS-XB33 is no exception! I bought this speaker to replace a JBL Flip 4 that I gave to my brother's girlfriend. Like all the XTRA BASS devices, the sound is crisp and clean with deep bass. I think It could have been louder. The party lights could have been better visually. And I wish the buttons on the control panel & the access panel in the back were illuminated for easier use. This speaker plays bigger than it looks. The party lights are... well I've seen better. But you'll get more playing time with them OFF. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW -- There's no AUX input. The speaker ships with the party lights & XTRA BASS ON. You can turn them OFF from the speaker, but there's very few audio or illumination settings otherwise. For those reasons, I recommend installing the Sony Music Center app on your Apple or Android device. It's very easy to use and offers multiple illumination settings, as well as additional audio settings; to include an equalizer. For additional party settings, also install Sony Fiestable. It automatically integrates with the Music Center app, but works indepently for other party functions. The speaker uses a USB Type C Charger, (in the packaging, no plug) and It has Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity. U could even connect via NFC. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase! It has pretty good tech & great sound.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2021",AHPEAYDD3GXEYQWAQT5VWMLSVMQA,True,3,Color: Black
R20RX5L3XO0XZW,B086D4JNGM,5.0 out of 5 stars Good Sound Decent Value. Minor Flaws.,JMR,5,"I don't like the fact I can not pair this with my older ipads... At $100+ you would figure it can. I can pair it with newer Ipads and older androids with no problem. ( I use my older tech as Media players... TV, Music, Pics, etc.) I am a noob when it comes to high tech so my knowledge is limited but I can get around.I do like the sound. Its not over the top but it is enough to hear it from far. Bass is good as well. Not sure about the water proof part as I have not tested it in the water yet. I have had it out in the snow a few times and its been covered in snow but with the days here are at below freezing I cant consider this water yet since you can just blow of the snow from it... (Bought in Jan review in Feb)What I really like is the lights. My 7 Year old loves them as well. With covid around we have dance parties at our house ( we turn the lights off and dance to his favorite music) just the 3 of us... but we definitely enjoy the lights and sound quality.Battery is awesome. It'll last me about a week of 3 - 4 hours a day listening to it. Sometimes 2 weeks depending on use. I tells you once the battery is low which is pretty cool. It doesn't bring an ac adapter though. But you get an usb cord. Its a downside but if you own any tech you probably have a million laying around...I would definitely recommend it. It is a bit bulky (heavy and big) but I like its size.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2021",AEOSAPIV4Z4GO7I5K3W7A7MLESMQ,True,4,Color: Black

Download the Sony app and adjust the settings, and it opens up the sound tremendously. The fact that this is IP67 made this a perfect option for around the beach or water. I took it on my kayak and I didn't worry about dropping it in the water or getting splashed, and battery life was more than enough for a 5 hour trip. I am sure there are better sounding speakers out there, but for the sub $100 range I cant imagine you will find much better then this for the price and the IP rating. The volume was loud enough for outdoor use, as everyone in my group could hear the music from at least 50 yards away.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2021",AH2YFSCHLRC6SD4GAWVVGJJ5BRWA,True,0,Color: Red
R2U8WVANEQPJ1Q,B086D4JNGM,4.0 out of 5 stars I work outside and it gets the job done!,TechnoNinja,4,"The media could not be loaded. It is not as loud as jbl speakers in its price range but it is loud enough to be heard several feet away outside. I work outside in urban community gardens and there is a lot of noises competing on being the loudest.My usual work day is shoveling stuff and so sound of several shovels scraping can be pretty loud. I keep the xb33 at 100% and the music is not drowned out by outdoor sounds. The speaker last about 8-10 hours at full volume on live mode or extra bass mode. Stamina mode can last 24 hours but it feels pointless to drop that much on a speaker and not use it's full potential.One of my coworkers has a jbl charge 5 but everyone prefers my xb33 despite it not being as loud. The xb33 makes up for its lack of loudness by having a much better balanced sound stage. You can hear every instrument and detail clearly and it doesn't get lost when you turn up the volume. The jbl speakers aeem to only focua on vocals,, mids, highs, and booming bass. The same songs can sound noticeably different on each speaker.Regarding music, this speaker is versatile. I use it to play trip hop, hip hop, drum & bass, jpop, rock, metal, soul, funk, dub, Latin jazz, orchestral, house and pop music and it all sounds great on it. The speaker doesn't have bias for any genre or elements but with the equalizer app you can get some customization. I have a video showing off the different songs I have playing on it.The range is fantastic and lives up to marketing. I had coworkers pair to my speaker and the walk offsite to do something else. Their phone would still be playing music through the speaker after they left but once they left the 66 feet range then it would disconnect.It lives up to being waterproof I used it in the rain and it worked perfectly fine. I spilt soda on it and ran water on it and it wasn't damaged at all either. I never worry about getting the speaker dirty because I know I can rinse the dirt off.I bought mine used for $60 and was surprised by how new it looks and perform. Don't be afraid of buying these used if you wanna save some money.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2022",AERYKX4I4LBC775EW7DB6WLNRSMQ,True,19,Color: Black
REH36D64QXBG5,B086D4JNGM,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound for the shower or a tiny room, annoying song control buttons, 4 hour battery life",Ariel Fisher,4,"ITEM REVIEWED: SONY SRSXB33I like pop and rock music and I am an audiophile who buys high end speakers, amps, and subwoofers.This speaker sounds AWESOME in a very small space, such as an enclosed shower. Even all by itself, just a single channel I enjoy listening to it almost as much as a much larger powerful system.Unfortunate drawbacks though. By far the worst drawback is the terribly annoying song control buttonsThere SHOULD be a separate button for PAUSE, NEXT SONG, and GO BACK A SONG. Instead all 3 are the same button. Press once to pause, twice fast to go forward, thrice fast to go back. Insanely annoying.Very often you try to SKIP THE SONG and instead pause and unpause. Drawback #2: Only runs a bit over 4 hours at max volume, and WORSE YET announces audibly PLEASE RECHARGE with at least an hour left.Drawback #3: Only powerful enough for a very small space such as an enclosed shower. You will need way more than ONE of these for larger rooms. Worth it if all you need is a shower speaker and don't mind the annoying song controls. Nice to be able to answer phone calls in the shower:).Took off a full star due to the insane lack of proper song control buttons.Update 3/4/22:Comparison to the OONTZ ANGLE 3 ULTRA (2 tone BLUE COLOR):The Sony has a bit more bass feel to it, but bear in mind that the SONY is about 4 times the size and weight of the OONTZ and more than double the price. Unless you care about the gimmicky lights (yes they are cool) in the SONY, the OONTZ is far superior simply because of the song control buttons which are 3 separate buttons on the OONTZ, rather than one button and a song and dance about how many times to press it on the SONY. The OONTZ also pairs more reliably and easily to the bluetooth host than does the SONY. Overall max volume and music quality is almost identical on the 2 except the bass is fuller on the SONY due to its greater heft. Battery life is FAR SUPERIOR on the OONTZ - lasting at least 12 hours at MAX vs. 4 on the SONY.","Reviewed in the United States February 18, 2022",AGAIJRXU7OM7GW45NHJPLLVW2XPA,True,5,Color: Blue

R3P4QT9D0W8PQQ,B086D4JNGM,3.0 out of 5 stars Not What I Anticipated,Charles Chaffee,3,"When I bought this I perhaps didn’t do enough research. I bought it for the purpose of the cross country backpacking trip I am considering undertaking. That being said, there’s nothing particularly horrible about the speaker per se; but for my purpose it seems highly impractical.First, while the lights (as pictured above) and corresponding apps you can download are neat little gimmicks when sitting in your living room, etc. they are not something that I feel are a true selling point. I am most concerned with sound quality and battery capacity. Secondly, it seems quite a bit larger than seemingly necessary for the sound it produces… I also have a JBL Charge 4 that I’ve had for going on 2 years now. It is not only smaller but packs a bigger “punch” (and by “punch” I am not meaning to say the JBL has better sound quality; just that it hits harder from a smaller unit).As far as sound quality goes, this Sony XB33 (maybe I should have spent $100 more on the 43) does nothing to really blow me away. It doesn’t sound bad whatsoever, and the clarity is really good. The sound seems to carry better than the JBL, and the clarity as far as distinguishing between different aspects of the song is definitely better. But it does nothing to blow me away. Again: it’s a $149 (or whatever it costed) speaker and it is far worth that as far as sound quality goes.The battery life seems pretty good as well, though not so sure it surpasses the Charge 4… I’m sure there are settings that can be adjusted (no lights, bass boost off, etc) that will prolong that. I have not had it long enough to experiment with that yet however.One neat feature I found was the little three channel (Low, Mid, High) equalizer that can be found in the app. It is an ice touch.One thing I don’t like is the completely un-rugged feel of this thing. No doubt it’s fine for the house and backyard, deck, etc… but I won’t be taking it on a 1000 mile backpacking trip.Reading over everything I wrote here I realize it seems as though I’m dissing this thing. That was not the intention. It sounds good. It is a great price. It has some nice (albeit I feel unnecessary) features. It seems a bit bulky and doesn’t feel quite rugged enough for my personal taste. Otherwise nothing else I can point out.If you want a nice Bluetooth speaker for your house, room, office—whatever—this seems like a good choice","Reviewed in the United States September 14, 2021",AFA6MXD4SAQA7VDAQ2CNBDWTZGGA,True,2,Color: Taupe

ROP40ONFLIY5M,B086D4JNGM,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent sound, easy pairing with buttons, but no aux input",Jason Dunn,4,"I'm pretty picky about my Bluetooth speakers, and normally go for Anker products, but when I saw The Wirecutter rate the Sony SRS-XB33 speaker so highly I figured I'd give it a try.Long story short, I was so impressed with the first one I bought, I purchased a second one so I could put them in ""party mode"" and use two at the same time. The sound is excellent: full, rich, and a decent amount of bass for something this small. The software app is pretty rough, and it has a frustrating limitation of not remembering the speaker pairing. It does allow you to control the lights on the speakers, which is a nice touch. I discovered that using the buttons on the back are a much easier way of creating the speaker pairing, so I do that each time - I wish it would just remember the setup like my older, cheaper VAVA speakers do.My one knock against this product is the lack of an AUX input. There are situations where having an AUX input is really handy - like when I want to take the audio from my Nintendo Switch and put it out to the speakers. I got around that by using a Bluetooth audio transmitter from the Switch, but the audio levels are lower so it's not ideal. This would be a 5-star product if it has an AUX input.Overall this is a great product, and I love that Sony offers this speaker in bold, beautiful colours - I went with the red, and it's awesome looking!","Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2020",AG4TNMGWFXUNI5TZANSMQHPYOXEA,True,21,Color: Red
RU9MWWHIOY9UT,B086D4JNGM,3.0 out of 5 stars Sony vs JBL - Not terrible but Not great,Amazon Customer,3,"I purchased this speaker in December of ‘21 and have genuinely been waiting to give it a review to see how I actually like it. Unfortunately, I’m less than impressed with this speaker. The speaker does have a decent sound - as in the speaker works. However, I don’t feel like I can figure out the right sound settings. It’s either too much bass and not enough voice or too much voice and no bass. This speaker also has a very forward sound. If you are standing to the side or back of the speaker you can hardly hear the sound. I used to have a JBL and switched to Sony. The JBL has a very 360 sound where you can set the speaker anywhere and hear it everywhere. With the Sony I’m constantly having to move the speaker with me so I can hear the sound. The Sony Music Center app you use to adjust the effects is also kind of odd and pointless. The speaker itself doesn’t have a great sound like the JBL does so it’s hard to pinpoint what settings you need to make it sound better. There’s also a ‘Live’ button on the speaker itself that Sony touts should fill a room more with sound and be a more ‘live concert’ feel. I unfortunately don’t hear much difference at all between Live on and Live off. Overall, I should have stuck with my gut and JBL instead of switching. Again, in my opinion? not a terrible speaker but also not great.","Reviewed in the United States October 3, 2022",AHOKBZV2EYHME4H436RMEI2S7DKA,True,6,Color: Black

R189XI8M77ZQQB,B086D4JNGM,"2.0 out of 5 stars it does the job, but there are way better speakers out there.",sophia,2,"(I got the sony srs-xb33) It’s a fine speaker, if you don’t mind or really note differences in sound quality, but even then you could find other speaker at a similar price that sounds better and is louder- loll. I saw many comments saying the volume is relatively low and now that I have it and used it, I understand what they meant and it’s true. From the first time I used it like two days ago I was like oh wow, it is low… If you’re just using it to listen to some music while you’re home it’s definitely loud enough. But again, for the size and price you can find something better. It produces a low volume even when it’s loud. I wanted to test this out so I compared it to another speaker I have (same song and approx same volume). The other speaker was noticeably louder. I even raised the volume more on the sony, and STILL my other speaker was louder. Not only that but the other speaker had amazing sound quality. Before doing this comparison today to test the “loudness,” I already noted that the sound quality wasn’t all that great. Even if you mess with the EQ the sony music center app, it doesn’t help all that much. The sound just isn’t crisp and rich. It was easy to connect, and the bluetooth worked out nicely. The range was good too, it still worked fine as I left my phone in one spot of the house and took the speaker with me in other rooms. If you want a speaker just to have around the house, it’ll be fine, it’s not horrible but honestly, it’s not that great of a speaker. I’d recommend looking for another one. Also, this may be a bit random but I really didn’t like how tiny the cable is, that was the first thing I didn’t like when I opened it for the first time lol. It’s like 21 inches. A small cable is fine for other products but it’s a bit inconvenient to have such a small cable for the portable speaker. I only charged it when I got it as instructed on the pamphlet that shows you how to connect to the speaker. The battery is still high and I’ve used it a bit in the past two days. I feel like you’ll run into the same things if you get the srs-xb43, it’s just bigger really.

R3VLEJMH8AHE3,B086D4JNGM,3.0 out of 5 stars No LDAC in stereo mode. Not advertised and a big negative.,grinder,3,"I recently purchased two SRS-XB33 speakers. I researched LDAC vs aptX codecs and given the LDAC high bandwidth and the overall good reviews of this speaker, thought this was the best choice.After receiving the speakers I paired the first one with my phone and saw in both the phone settings (including the developer options) and the Sony Music Center app, that LDAC/HD audio was being used. However, when I stereo paired the second speaker, LDAC went dead and the connection protocol switched to SBC (the base codec for Bluetooth connectivity). I checked all the settings and all the HD options on the phone were greyed out. I searched the web and Sony literature for answers. Why advertise LDAC and its increased bandwidth if it can only be used on a mono speaker? Also, Sony's Bluetooth headphones maintain stereo sound while in LDAC, so what's the difference? I never did find out. I was finally able to chat with a Sony rep and they confirmed that LDAC is not available in stereo mode. Makes no sense to me that it is what it is.If you're looking for great stereo sound from two of these, forget it. Instead, you need to look for a pair that has aptX HD, LL or adaptive capabilities.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2022",AGPKMQBQTEEASFQ47DWKL2YMFFUQ,True,0,Color: Black

Simone K,3,"I'm not sure if this will make sense but this speaker ""sounds"" like bass but does not ""feel"" like bass. The video reviews I saw for this speaker only play dub step/pop music or rock with some ""bass"" melodies. I took a chance because I liked the look/style of the speaker. I also am a sucker for flashing lights that dance to the music which this does. When I saw the product labeled as ""extra bass"" I was wary, but I wanted to try anyway. It does boast a full sound (a nice live sound). But when you turn it up full volume on your phone/device and on the speaker, the speaker starts to sound garbled and static-y. When I see a product labeled extra bass I want to be embrassed to play it in my apartment complex. I want my floors to shake. I want someone knocking on my door. I recommend if you want that experience go for the Harmon/Kardon speaker as it seems to be better designed for this. The main reason I kept it was the portability and size of it. I think it does provide good sound, but it is no Beats or JBL.","Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2022",AFT7T5ZMSM3BIXDT34X4Z457R32A,True,0,Color: Taupe

Aside from the bass I really like the somewhat triangular shape; it's easy to grab and carry around. It connects quickly and has fantastic range from my cell phone. The battery life depends on how loud you play it, but will last plenty long enough for a day's worth of activities. Made of high quality parts and a better app the only downside I've found is that you have to download a second app to control the lights, but they can be manually turned off on the back of the unit.

Also, if low volume listening is a priority this is probably the best in class for that.Maybe if you have a bedroom/office combo and listen to it on low volumes primarily, it would be a fit for you, otherwise look elsewhere.I compared this side-by-side against the LG PL7 and Anker Soundcore motion+ and this came 2nd out of the three for me (#1 is Anker for the price and overall sound)","Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2020",AGMVWZXWYAXHR4NI5FSFAUHFM6XA,True,6,Color: Black

Overall the sound quality is just ok. I purchased this as several reviewers stated it had great sound quality and bass. Obviously I understand this is a small Bluetooth speaker and do not expect it to sound like the 2 12” subs in my car. However I did expect a little bit of bass tones based on the design and weight of the speaker. Any song with actual bass will distort the sound quality severely almost to the point it sounds like its blowing the speakers out even when only turned half way up. Battery life isn’t the best either. This unit usually lasts a couple of hours while riding around on the golf cart listening to it. The longest it has lasted me on a full charge is about 4-5 hours so definitely not something you want to purchase and try to use outdoors without a power supply for extended periods of time. For the price and quality I would not recommend this product. I have a JBL Clip 3 that weighs less than a third of the xb33 and honestly out performs it in just about everyway from sounds quality to battery life.

Since the intent is to use on a PWC where it will need to overcome engine noise, I have no confidence in it being loud enough. I suspected this would be the case when Sony refused to discuss specifications such as SPL or wattage and compare it to the competition. Sadly I waited well over a week for delivery as Amazon has had trouble getting stock of this new unit. Also, the NFC feature didn't work with my Samsung phone.
