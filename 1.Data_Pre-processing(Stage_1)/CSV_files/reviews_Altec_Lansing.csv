Sound quality good for the brief minutes it played. Sent to Altec under warranty within a day or so of delivery. Waited 2 weeks. After Altec returned to me, it charged the first time. Used for 2 hours. Tried to charge it again, but wouldn't charge. Maybe my luck with Altec Lansing products. I probably wouldn't buy Altec Lansing again.This is the second straight Lansing product I bought with technical issues. A compact speaker,Model IMW1100 worked for just few weeks then stopped charging. I returned to Amazon and bought another one (same IMW 1100). The replacement charges but the illuminating lighting system does not work. I got tired of returning to Amazon and just kept it.

RRE0VSA3GGLA7,B0BSNZJGTX,5.0 out of 5 stars Loud bang for the Buck!,R-N,5,"Great bargain for what all that you get- portability, long battery charge, volume, and sound quality. Even has different light modes, but for me, that is a useless gimmick. But for a party, may be a welcome gimmick.I've used this the last few months outside while working in the yard, and indoors- gym and while working in my basement. Cranked up, the sound fills my large yard and maintains sound quality, especially for a portable speaker. And no worries if it starts to rain, won't be affected. Nonetheless, I haven't attempted to test its full water resistant potential by dunking it in a pool or directing a hose on it (why?).In the house, at a ""normal"" volume, the battery last hours/days. So far, I have gone a few days of listening for a couple hours each without plugging it in. Also, it easily connects via bluetooth to my iPhone and keeps that connection for a range of 50ft plus. When I use it in the yard, I either leave my phone near the speaker, or I use my iPad or old phone to connect with Spotify or Apple Music so as not to be restricted to the limitations of Bluetooth range.","Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2023",AGA6WFKFQPYJ7QHSOTSHKQXXXD6Q,True,1,Color: Red

I watched the video on Amazon and the review seemed accurate, although the speakers on an iPad are only so good...I purchased from Amazon and it arrived promptly.I charged it fully and linked it to my phone. It took a moment to link, but was fine. Using the controls for the audio on my phone, I proceeded to run it through it's paces.Volume is good although there is no adjustment on the speaker itself, nor any type of adjustment for sound in anyway.The lights are cool but not necessarily something I cared about either way.Battery life is great. I use it daily for 6 to 8 hours and only charge it once a week.Having a dedicated bass speaker, I expected a better bass sound. At full volume, it's good but not great.For me, it's a ok speaker at the price.Would be a great buy at $100 but no more.If you want sound and flashing lights, could be for you...great sound quality, there are better choices for the price.","Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2023",AE2BXLCPCO3WZWJ5FF4JBU5S3NWA,True,2,Color: Black

It's held up well!!I run this on my ATV I did buy the warranty tho just bc I ride in the rain and mud!I did add some clear silicon on the seams of the box and where the cord plugs into I do cover it up with gorilla tape!!It's loud the lights are obnoxiously bright!And rode through a 3 hour downpour and the thing never skipped a beat! If you use the light and blare the music non stop your lucky to get 5 hours of play time on it. Without the lights a solid 7-8 hours on high!Update: 4/6/2024This speaker has been pretty amazing tbh it it still loud and the charge has went down over constant use, however I modified a cord to be able to charge it as I ride for more than 6hr long trips.. now it’s not completely watertight. The plug in area if it gets wet it won’t charge you’ll have to let it dry out really good. The one thing I’ve done is just seal that area up with ductape I know kinda lame but overall great speaker with some modifications lol. Also had this in my kayak when I tipped over I didn’t test the floating capability 100% knowing it’s not fully sealed tight.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2023",AGMCVTBU2FBEGPEOB27ZDQT6RYTQ,True,2,Color: Red
R3QF9UCDLO9TJF,B0BSNZJGTX,5.0 out of 5 stars Like my old school boombox on steroids,The OG Elf,5,"The media could not be loaded. DANG, this is like my old school boombox on steroids. I got it for a houseparty we were throwing for my daughter's 21st birthday. I seriously felt like I was back in college. The sound on this thing is BEYOND!! The front facing woofers give you that heart thumping, rumbling sound and great quality bass. The sound is crisp and super clear with no distortion. Along with rocking sound quality, it's got 4 different LED lighting modes. You can set it to a slow fade, multi-color slow fade, solid blue or it'll beat to music. I wish I would've gotten a video at the party, but we were having too much fun and I forgot. It charges very quickly and you can get around 20 hours of playtime. That's insane!! You can charge it with the normal wall charger that it comes with or use the USB charging port to connect to a USB power source, like a power bank, laptop or wall outlet. You can also charge your phone with it while using the speaker. It'll connect to any bluetooth enabled device and has a 100 foot range. It's easy to pair and after the first time it will automatically connect to your device when you turn the speaker on. It's crazy, but you can connect up to 50 House Party enabled speakers at the same time. WHAT?!?! That'd be like your own concert. The functionality and options are amazing. It's even waterproof, so I can use it in my pool. That's going to be amazeballs this summer!! If you want a powerful, high quality speaker with sound that'll knock your socks off, stop looking and buy this speaker.

When I plugged the charger in the red light didn't show and even after charging for awhile still nothing. I had another charger that i tried and there was that little red light to show me it was charging. After 14 hours on charge the light was still red so i was able to turn it on and try it out and it does sound pretty awesome! BUT.. for the price i want a speaker that charges and holds a charge. I called the company per the instructions and did not return to amazon as I would have to pay more to replace the speaker as it's not on sale anymore and I have to send it back to the company WHENEVER they send me my prepaid label and from there they will test it themselves and should ship a new speaker out within 15 days after that...

TLDR: after 4 years, It's worth $200.Longer story: I listen to normal music and offer it up to dispensaries I work at as a lobby speaker. Along with that, I've used bass boosting equalizers while listening to speaker intensive songs and have accidentally taken the altec to volume levels of rattling inside of its casing (for 4 years now) and there's still PERFECT clarity in the highs and no signs of subwoofer damage.My phone speaker has DEFINITELY seen some water damage so the audio sounds terrible in the video I attached, but you can hear it get plenty loud enough and not have any rattling. You really gotta push it to rattle the walls levels before that happens.But yeah, I've dropped it.. A lot. A few times into some hot springs. We've had some wild nights with the boys together.

It's very easy to use, intuitive layout for the buttons on the device. The LEDs are bright and really amplify the party mood even in a home setting.

But for me, this was the bad.The LED's that are supposed to give you a 'cool' atmosphere were defective on TWO of the units I tried. I went through Amazon's return process and received an identical unit with the exact same issue.When for instance cycling through colors, and setting it to BLUE, or RED; all of the LED's are supposed to be the same color.On both of the units I tried out, there was always ONE LED that was the wrong color. This may not seem to be a big deal, but when you set it to a specific color, and only ONE LED is a different color, it looks dumb. I contacted the manufacturer and was told it was most likely a manufacturing error. This is a shame, because honestly it sounded great. But my OCD couldn't handle there always being one LED out of sync with the others. Even setting it to multiple colors, it just looked off. I have returned my second one, and will be waiting a while before trying again. Hopefully others don't have the issue that I did, but if this would bug you, as it did me, I would wait and allow them to sort the problem out at the manufacturing level.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2021",AFSVVRABVIK2M3VSSHDBVYROL6SQ,True,5,Color: Steel Grey

It is very loud as well.I will give an update on the claimed ""20 hr battery life"" and the proclaimed ""waterproof"" and ""shockproof"" claims on the box.Also I feel that it should be mentioned that there is a 3.5mm audio out jack on this unit. This is an antiquated feature with the existence of Bluetooth but is occasionally a necessity as in the case of my budget screen projector which does not have Bluetooth connectivity. The box does not include a dedicated 3.5mm audio out line. It is just a nice additional feature that js not mentioned on the official Altec Lansing website description of the product.

RKXRR3FXIFUNY,B0BSNZJGTX,"1.0 out of 5 stars Were the reviews fake, or is my product defective?",Isiah E.,1,"I purchased the speaker in May of this year; hoping that I would not have to purchase another speaker for years to come. I'll be honest, this was definitely not worth the money and I'll explain why. The sound quality itself is lackluster. The audio clarity is just horrendous. I compared the audio clarity to that of my Amazon echo studio which I have as part of my home theater setup and the echo studio is far clearer. The speaker also isn't very loud unless you're in a rather small space with barely any people. This speaker wasn't bad for the game nights I hosted at my apartment but lord knows this thing is terrible outside, especially if someone else is also playing music on their own speakers. The battery life of this thing is severely disappointing. I might have only used this speaker a handfull of times since purchasing it, and I generally don't use it for more than 3 hours at a time but I put this speaker to the test on June 3rd as I did a cookout. The speaker with the lights on, only lasted AT MOST 5 hours! This speaker was fully charged before I used it, I even put it on the charger from the night before and only took it off directly before leaving to cook out. The lights were on, the volume was on max, and this fully charged speaker died literally within 5 hours! I'm not sure if the lights plus max volume severely drained the battery or what. I also don't like the fact that you cannot play music while a microphone is plugged in as it will disconnect your Bluetooth. Even with the mic plugged in, the sound from the mic is so low on this speaker that you barely hear it! There is no problem with the mic as I've tested it on other devices, the problem was the speaker. Overall this was a really bad purchase on my end. I bought this because of all of the positive reviews, and while I still respect others opinion on this product, I did not have a good experience with this product. Please beware that if you have or have had pretty good speakers in the past then this one will be nothing special.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2022",AGTBCXX4ZU5X433XWCGO7OWQRS7Q,True,4,Color: Red

I have purchased a few other speakers from this store and I really like each of them. This is the first bluetooth speaker brand I have owned that allows you to connect more than one speaker at one time. I love the surround sound option the music is crisp and clear. This speaker is much larger than I originally expected I guess I didn't pay attention to the measurements posted. It states that it floats in water however I will not purposely put it in water I am to afraid it will get damaged. I will be bring it to the pond with us every weekend so it may get splashed but thats about all I will allow. I love that the speaker illuminates the colors are so cool.

After a few minutes of floating the box will stop playing. You then need to make sure all the water gets out, and leave it to dry out for up to a week before it will play music clearly again. the first couple of days after floating it, it will not play at all, then slowly gets better over the next few days as it plays muffled & grainy. They manufactured this with a poorly engineered ""water tight"" cap that is easy to put on, but hard to remove, and doesnt keep water out anyway. Not sure why they didnt engineer a tighter cap with that could screw on with a sealed o-ring, it would be a simple fix and could make it a good floating box, but there you are. Also the device I received is definitely not a fluke or onece off defect.

I have a higher watt rating bluetooth speaker that can get louder than the RockBox but the speaker quality of the RockBox sounds way better than the other one from AOMAIS. RockBox can get still really loud if you push it to the max volume without having the sound quality wash out since the ferrite speakers can be pushed harder than alot of bluetooth speakers.

I got one for my work truck and my truck is loud because from bouncing and bumps in the road. The sound is outstanding and nice and loud. You can get anywhere from 12-15 hrs on a full charge. Well worth the money.Update: 3/10/23: As expected the battery life has diminished. Runs about 4 hrs and has to be charged. I still love it though. I just leave it plugged in.,"Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2021",AG2MQPA5XO3OA3OUTVWSA674ESQA,True,0,Color: Steel Grey
R2YE1JU4PTBLO6,B0BSNZJGTX,5.0 out of 5 stars HOLY MOLY ! ! ! !,Dean,5,"Hands down this is the BEST sounding speaker of it's kind in the marketplace. SUPERB clarity and B A S S ! ! ! Loud enough indoors to keep the party going, for sure. Make sure you are buying this version though. It has become harder and harder to find due to newer/similar versions coming out. I know from personal experience because I have purchased them. They are really good, but not as AMAZING as this one.

R3C268ET1KZXEO,B0BSNZJGTX,"2.0 out of 5 stars Was awesome, until it wasn't.",Amazon Customer,2,"The device sounds great and I get compliments on it when I take it out with me. It has replaced my other speakers due to its versatility and size.I was using it at the pool and all of a sudden the device rebooted itself 3 times. None of the buttons are responsive and the device has 60% battery love left.I called support and they will replace it, not they do not have the red version in stock. Really disappointed with this issue and am not sure if(could fully having it after this problem.Before this issue I was just taking a few people how awesome the speaker is, now I'm here waiting for sorry to send me a label to so it back and wait for a replacement.... Not happy.","Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2022",AF2TUCUOFMDSEAFO5PME7KPSWFWQ,True,0,Color: Red
