R22P9TAALZTP3X,B0B43Y8GHZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome speaker.,Stephen M.,5,"The sound of this speaker is incredible. Good highs and great bass. It was very easy to set up.It's not super heavy, but feels very solid. So far, the battery lasts a long time in between charges. It comes with wall charger. I would definitely recommend this speaker. I also got it on sale at a great price. The light is pretty cool too. You also have more control with the Sony Music center app.","Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2024",AF7LYPOQCT7STDHZITCSNE24VFIQ,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG300/B
R123BOARGUG1WM,B0B43Y8GHZ,5.0 out of 5 stars All around great speaker,A like minded person,5,"I bought the bigger 500 series and thought to get the 300 series. While the 300 series is smaller and doesn’t offer some of the features that the 500 series offers, it’s a great smaller alternative that provides plenty of volume and bass. The speaker is waterproof and dust proof to a certain extent. I like the C drive charger which is very convenient. Saltwater and sand got on this speaker and it still performs flawlessly. Very happy with it considering its size.","Reviewed in the United States August 20, 2024",AEIXT4EMUTOBCXAIK4QDHTA3VPYQ,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG300/B
R1NBOJS21O8D3K,B0B43Y8GHZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely incredible battery,Rodney Molidor,5,"This Sony XG500 boombox sounds good and has absolutely world-class battery life, and fast charging. However there are better sounding speakers for the money, and some that cost far less that sound just as good(Skullcandy barrel xt for example). This boombox has great features, including TWO USB-A ports so you can use one to play music from a USB stick, and another to charge your phone, plus a mic/guitar input! For me, the battery life is hugely important, and I can not overstate how long this battery lasts and how quickly it charges back up. FAR superior to all the others I have owned. And it sounds good, not the best, but plenty good enough. I absolutely love it.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AGCI7M4EX5GHPCKJUSXWLKXVMADA,True,6,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG500
R2T2U63981MT2C,B0B43Y8GHZ,4.0 out of 5 stars Sounds Great When Dialed In,Mike Blumenberg,4,"Out of the box, this speaker sounds pretty mediocre. But just tinker with the EQ, and it comes to life. It's a little big, and kinda heavy, but the built in handle makes transport a breeze - and it lays flat when not in use. The speaker is very well designed, and looks great. It gets fairly loud, but nothing too crazy. The JBLs definitely get louder, but I like the sound quality of the Sony better. At low to mid volumes, you can get over 12 hours of constant playing from the speaker. At near full volume, it's more like 6-8. If you like how it looks, and are in the market for this style speaker, give it a shot. I think you'll like it.","Reviewed in the United States March 20, 2024",AHHXAFJW5QRATN2RFEG5TFFQHOXQ,True,11,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG300/B
R178FXIZIZC5U8,B0B43Y8GHZ,5.0 out of 5 stars A speaker worthy of the Sony name,Efrem Alexander,5,"This is a outstanding speaker, once you tune it with some EQ adjustments, out of the box the sound signature is warm and could be off-putting if you're expecting more clarity, but it is there you just have to know how to set it up. First make sure the LDAC is engaged and I also found the live setting to get more clarity and sparkle than the megebass setting and last but not least use a third party music app (I recommend Musicolet) it has multiple EQ band settings and also preamp to boost the volume of your music.With these 3 factors addressed this speaker produces some of the most well-balanced sound of all my Bluetooth speakers especially for its size, just like a fine instrument, it has to be tuned to get the best sound quality from it!!","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2024",AEBN67HUWEPFLVQN4KCYKDGAWVRQ,True,8,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRSXG300/H
R3GLIWDFDEK5IL,B0B43Y8GHZ,"5.0 out of 5 stars Speaker With Feature and Skill! (Bow Hunting Skills, Numchuck skills, you know the rest....)",Natascha,5,"+The sound is amazing,+the battery life seems to last forever (especially if you turn off lights and bass boost, but even leaving them on...I'm still so impressed)+It looks super nice. I use this primarily as a home speaker actually that I move around at times, and I think it's a great speaker serving that role, too. I find it impressive truly as an ALL IN ONE product, you know? I must say, even after reviews, this speaker is better experienced in person than the reviews can even show. It's truly impressive. I think when asking if you should buy this or not, the answer is definitely YES if you want the extra features. For example,++ being able to turn this into a guitar amp is gonna make me feel especially cool when I very poorly sing and play guitar. I don't know how often I'll use this, but to have that as an option as actually pretty freaking sweet.++ Being able to charge things from my speaker, even if pretty slowly, is cool and useful.++ Being able to plug in an amazon echo into this speaker and have Alexa voice activated assistance is also freaking sweet. Having such a long battery life is a convenience even just using this mostly as a home speaker.This speaker really does rock! ;) It has numchuck skills, bow hunting skills, it just has skillz. It's NOICE!(I hope this review helps someone in some way. Remember to embrace your inner Napoleon.)which one, you say?You decide!Do you want this even at all AND you have the money? If so, go for it! If you want to spend less and don't mind lacking a few features, (features lik a guitar amp plug, an aux plug, two usb a charging ports, and a super long battery life), consider other options like the Soundcore Motion Boom Plus. You can spend half the price and get something that sounds really, really good still if just having something that plays good sounding music is your primary concern. It will lack some features, but they may be things you wouldn't really prioritize or use often anyway on a more feautre ridden speaker. Being poor, sometimes spending more really pays off, but it doesn't always. Sometimes I'm just as satisfied with a product at a lower price that still has 98% of the other features in common with higher priced items. Does paying more pay off here? Well, I think for the most part yes. I think the features really are fun.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2023",AECHBLEF5TE4MITCQKBMC4TNVGWQ,True,19,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG500

R35AIMWYE6RUG1,B0B43Y8GHZ,1.0 out of 5 stars Wretched Device Connectivity,daniascrewedme,1,"Once the speaker is turned on, any device that is connected to it can interrupt whatever is being currently being played through a speaker. For example, I'm playing a podcast through my speaker and then I receive a phone call on my phone. As soon as I answer the phone call, it's now playing through my speaker. In other words, it changed devices on me without any prompting, and this cannot be controlled.There isn't a way to remove devices that are connected to the speaker, and the app that ""controls"" the speaker is equally unhelpful. Poor design, decent sound, and an awful experience. I love Sony, but I will never buy another speaker from them again.","Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2024",AEHVRZE27YEKLPS6CLHF4IL7EDZA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG300/B

I purchased one, but wasn't satisfied with the sound.To use them as a pair you must download an app from Sony. You pair the speakers there. The app shows you the music programs on your device and you click there.However, I can't use both speakers for my iPod, as the iPod won't show up in the list on my phone (in the Sony app) it's ok though.

That being said, I do love having a large portable speaker that I can put in any room of the house and fill it with music or whatever. It's a bit heavy at 5 pounds and should definitely have had a better base for stability because I'm not sure how well it would survive a fall. It also doesn't seem to ever power off despite the settings I chose for that very reason. That being said, the battery life is ridiculously long and I can leave it on all day without any issues. I do love Sony products but I'm also glad I got this on a promotional sale ($100 off) because I likely wouldn't have paid the normal price.

R1WXFJO25KJ87Y,B0B43Y8GHZ,2.0 out of 5 stars Worse sound than expected,Strikeout321,2,"We have a large family that likes to listen to music. In my house, we own every JBL Bluetooth speaker (Clip, Flip, Charge, Extreme, Boombox, etc…and the different versions of them), we also have multiple UE speakers (Wonderboom, Boom, and MegaBoom), multiple Sonos speakers (Arc, Mini Sub, One SL, etc.), and one Bose speaker (it’s older, I forget what). Needless to say, I have a lot personal experience with these devices.In my opinion, this Sony SRS-XG300 is about as good as the JBL Charge 3 or 4 (not 5). I was actually surprised at how bad the low end sound is for this speaker considering its size, the bass is just not there no matter how you try and tune it. Using the Mega Bass button is almost laughable because all it does is add bass, without it, there’s virtually zero bass. The speaker is not room filling at all and can even sound kind of “tinny” during certain sounds with higher pitches. It might be great in a lab with specific sound measuring equipment, but in a real world setting, it doesn’t sound any better than a medium mid-level speaker that’s half its size.I paid $148 when it was on sale and would say that’s about the most I would ever pay for it…but honestly I would just avoid it altogether because even if you got it cheap, you’ll be disappointed once you use it. Go with a JBL Extreme or UE MegaBoom (if you want that larger size speaker), you will be much happier with your purchase. The JBL Boombox is my favorite Bluetooth speaker by far, but it’s stupid expensive and way overkill for most people.","Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2024",AGNGXFTNXGOGLV6JO4MVPOM5CUUQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG300/B

Here are the reasons why this was the right decision even though this speaker cost a little more.1. Battery life. I use this speaker 4 times a week for at least 5 hours and I only charge it once a month.2. Waterproof. I take this speaker on a small sailboat during regatta racing. It got not just wet but submerged in salt water few times when a wave washes through the cockpit. It still runs without issues. Afterwards a give it a rinse with fresh water garden hose.3. Sound levels. It has a great sound and packs a punch. The bass is strong. The treble could be clearer.4. It does have an auxiliary input even though it doesn’t specifically say that in the descriptions on amazon. Bluetooth works great too and is easy to connect.5. It is larger than the jbl speaker and heavier too but that is to be expected if my other points matter to you too.6. Dont buy the case that gets suggested with the product.

It can literally be dragged through a swamp during monsoon season and it won't miss a beat or soak up a molecule of moisture with its superior water tight design. is great when your spending the weekend in camp or at the beach when a sudden downpour shows up on an otherwise sunny day!

R29N740JAMD3NA,B0B43Y8GHZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Speaker with OK Battery Life,MichaelC,5,"Bought this to replace a broken Logitech Muvo 20 that I had purchased many moons ago. The general use is that it's our garage speaker, the kids use it when playing hoops and sauce toss. I also occasionally take it to the patio. Overall I think it has a much better sound than what it replaced with much heavier bass, in fact it could be a little too much for my taste with some music. The sound profiles help to adjust as needed. My expectations on these were pretty low given they are small battery powered speakers but I am impressed with what it produces. I did find the battery life seems to be just ok. We are charging it more than the old speaker but it could also be that the kids are playing it louder. That aside, I think Sony has a winner here.","Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2023",AGUGT4SGRWIFHNNEAPQUXZPM52WQ,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG300/B

R13KMAWPNAH8OD,B0B43Y8GHZ,1.0 out of 5 stars Something Wasn't Right!!!!!,MELLY Z,1,"I'm giving one star do to the fact that I felt something was ""off"" about the speaker itself as soon as I pulled it out of the box. It came with the cords and instruction manual BUT the speaker itself had no factory stickers or protective film. I found it odd because everyone knows upon purchasing new products - there is usually SOMETHING (such as a sticker and/or protective film) giving the purchaser some type of assurance that they just bought a BRAND NEW product. But I just tried brushing it off and plugged that baby in. I charged it and played a couple songs but that was it. It was late and so it wasn't until New Year's Eve that I had actually tried out the volume level and ""MEGA BASS"" feature and I noticed the second time I actually powered it on that there was definite distortion or static. My friend who was over noticed it as well. So after playing detective and after watching multiple un-boxing videos of the SONY SRS-XG500 I noticed they all came fresh up outta the box with two blue stickers located on the front of the speaker. MINE HAD NOTHING.I called SONY and they confirmed that it most definitely should have had the new stickers attached. They had me to two different reset features in hopes to fix the sound trouble - but to no avail.They (SONY) is sending me a pre-paid shipping label and sending me a NEW SONY SRS-XG500 from the actual warehouse. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVE I WAS SOLD A ""RETURNED/REFURBISHED"" speaker. I own a SONY speaker and its pretty old - RDH-GTK37 which has been through three pretty big parties and my daily listening habits with nothing to complain about.Just thought ya'll should know.","Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2023",AHTTJ3DUYNGE53YHQ5JOA6FG4FQA,True,16,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG500

R4DQ155HTANMP,B0B43Y8GHZ,1.0 out of 5 stars Worst ever I have seen- genuine review,saichand,1,"I have purchased on Amazon, it is delivered on 30Aug2024. I already had Sony 2016 year home theater ( sound bar + woofer). I thought this will enhance the experience by placing it behind couch.The sound quality is very cheap. No stereo. Very much lagging in playing stereo sounds. By pressing boss button it is playing elevated boss but lacking sound quality of crispy voices and detailed sound.My old Sony home theater is 100 times better.I wonder how Sony producing such cheap audio devices. Very much shame on them. Waste of your money. DON’T buy, you feel regrets.","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2024",AHOKLEBQ42FW4EM255UBE5NT72DA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG500

R1Z3RSFRKSA1FN,B0B43Y8GHZ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great but as a consumer in the farming industry, I can see a few improvement possibilities",Darin,4,"Great speaker highs to lows are all distinguishable, can hear is fairly clear over a track for at 75 percent. Can charge anything that has usb..What it does need is better/thicker material for the cloth cover. Also they should add a thin strip the rubber they use for it’s stands around the outer most part of the ring, as extra safety. If not for that I would give 5/5Maybe I’m petty but for the price they can deff do that.Aside from that this thing IS one of my favorite speaker puchases. thank you don’t for finally making a product I wanted enough to spend almost half a grand!!","Reviewed in the United States October 11, 2021",AGPAHHDOG4CHAVLO45MWX2YGJEOA,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG500
