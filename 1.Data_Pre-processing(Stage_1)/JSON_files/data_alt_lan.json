After Altec returned to me, it charged the first time. Used for 2 hours. Tried to charge it again, but wouldn't charge. Maybe my luck with Altec Lansing products. I probably wouldn't buy Altec Lansing again.This is the second straight Lansing product I bought with technical issues. A compact speaker,Model IMW1100 worked for just few weeks then stopped charging. I returned to Amazon and bought another one (same IMW 1100). The replacement charges but the illuminating lighting system does not work. I got tired of returning to Amazon and just kept it.

Even has different light modes, but for me, that is a useless gimmick. But for a party, may be a welcome gimmick.I've used this the last few months outside while working in the yard, and indoors- gym and while working in my basement. Cranked up, the sound fills my large yard and maintains sound quality, especially for a portable speaker. And no worries if it starts to rain, won't be affected. Nonetheless, I haven't attempted to test its full water resistant potential by dunking it in a pool or directing a hose on it (why?).In the house, at a \"normal\" volume, the battery last hours/days. So far, I have gone a few days of listening for a couple hours each without plugging it in. Also, it easily connects via bluetooth to my iPhone and keeps that connection for a range of 50ft plus. When I use it in the yard, I either leave my phone near the speaker, or I use my iPad or old phone to connect with Spotify or Apple Music so as not to be restricted to the limitations of Bluetooth range.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2023","profile_id":"AGA6WFKFQPYJ7QHSOTSHKQXXXD6Q","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":1,"product_attributes":"Color: Red"},{"id":"R1YPAGHWUWE7SS","title":"3.0 out of 5 stars Doesn't hold charge past 90%","author":"C","rating":3,"content":"Speaker sounds decent but does not hold a full charge.

It took a moment to link, but was fine. Using the controls for the audio on my phone, I proceeded to run it through it's paces.Volume is good although there is no adjustment on the speaker itself, nor any type of adjustment for sound in anyway.The lights are cool but not necessarily something I cared about either way.Battery life is great. I use it daily for 6 to 8 hours and only charge it once a week.Having a dedicated bass speaker, I expected a better bass sound. At full volume, it's good but not great.For me, it's a ok speaker at the price.Would be a great buy at $100 but no more.If you want sound and flashing lights, could be for you...great sound quality, there are better choices for the price.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2023","profile_id":"AE2BXLCPCO3WZWJ5FF4JBU5S3NWA","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":2,"product_attributes":"Color: Black"},{"id":"R1OBUL43Z2BFQO","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Rock Your World","author":"Kimchi Noodle","rating":5,"content":"In terms of durability, the Rockbox XL 2.0 is built to last.

It's held up well!!I run this on my ATV I did buy the warranty tho just bc I ride in the rain and mud!I did add some clear silicon on the seams of the box and where the cord plugs into I do cover it up with gorilla tape!!It's loud the lights are obnoxiously bright!And rode through a 3 hour downpour and the thing never skipped a beat! If you use the light and blare the music non stop your lucky to get 5 hours of play time on it. Without the lights a solid 7-8 hours on high!Update: 4/6/2024This speaker has been pretty amazing tbh it it still loud and the charge has went down over constant use, however I modified a cord to be able to charge it as I ride for more than 6hr long trips.. now it’s not completely watertight. The plug in area if it gets wet it won’t charge you’ll have to let it dry out really good. The one thing I’ve done is just seal that area up with ductape I know kinda lame but overall great speaker with some modifications lol.

DANG, this is like my old school boombox on steroids. I got it for a houseparty we were throwing for my daughter's 21st birthday. I seriously felt like I was back in college. The sound on this thing is BEYOND!! The front facing woofers give you that heart thumping, rumbling sound and great quality bass. The sound is crisp and super clear with no distortion. Along with rocking sound quality, it's got 4 different LED lighting modes. You can set it to a slow fade, multi-color slow fade, solid blue or it'll beat to music. I wish I would've gotten a video at the party, but we were having too much fun and I forgot. It charges very quickly and you can get around 20 hours of playtime. That's insane!! You can charge it with the normal wall charger that it comes with or use the USB charging port to connect to a USB power source, like a power bank, laptop or wall outlet. You can also charge your phone with it while using the speaker. It'll connect to any bluetooth enabled device and has a 100 foot range. It's easy to pair and after the first time it will automatically connect to your device when you turn the speaker on. It's crazy, but you can connect up to 50 House Party enabled speakers at the same time. WHAT?!?! That'd be like your own concert. The functionality and options are amazing. It's even waterproof, so I can use it in my pool. That's going to be amazeballs this summer!! If you want a powerful, high quality speaker with sound that'll knock your socks off, stop looking and buy this speaker.

TLDR: after 4 years, It's worth $200.Longer story: I listen to normal music and offer it up to dispensaries I work at as a lobby speaker. Along with that, I've used bass boosting equalizers while listening to speaker intensive songs and have accidentally taken the altec to volume levels of rattling inside of its casing (for 4 years now) and there's still PERFECT clarity in the highs and no signs of subwoofer damage.My phone speaker has DEFINITELY seen some water damage so the audio sounds terrible in the video I attached, but you can hear it get plenty loud enough and not have any rattling. You really gotta push it to rattle the walls levels before that happens.But yeah, I've dropped it.. A lot. A few times into some hot springs. We've had some wild nights with the boys together.

But for me, this was the bad.The LED's that are supposed to give you a 'cool' atmosphere were defective on TWO of the units I tried. I went through Amazon's return process and received an identical unit with the exact same issue.When for instance cycling through colors, and setting it to BLUE, or RED; all of the LED's are supposed to be the same color.On both of the units I tried out, there was always ONE LED that was the wrong color. This may not seem to be a big deal, but when you set it to a specific color, and only ONE LED is a different color, it looks dumb. I contacted the manufacturer and was told it was most likely a manufacturing error. This is a shame, because honestly it sounded great. But my OCD couldn't handle there always being one LED out of sync with the others. Even setting it to multiple colors, it just looked off. I have returned my second one, and will be waiting a while before trying again.

This is an antiquated feature with the existence of Bluetooth but is occasionally a necessity as in the case of my budget screen projector which does not have Bluetooth connectivity. The box does not include a dedicated 3.5mm audio out line. It is just a nice additional feature that js not mentioned on the official Altec Lansing website description of the product.

I'll be honest, this was definitely not worth the money and I'll explain why. The sound quality itself is lackluster. The audio clarity is just horrendous. I compared the audio clarity to that of my Amazon echo studio which I have as part of my home theater setup and the echo studio is far clearer. The speaker also isn't very loud unless you're in a rather small space with barely any people. This speaker wasn't bad for the game nights I hosted at my apartment but lord knows this thing is terrible outside, especially if someone else is also playing music on their own speakers. The battery life of this thing is severely disappointing. I might have only used this speaker a handfull of times since purchasing it, and I generally don't use it for more than 3 hours at a time but I put this speaker to the test on June 3rd as I did a cookout. The speaker with the lights on, only lasted AT MOST 5 hours! This speaker was fully charged before I used it, I even put it on the charger from the night before and only took it off directly before leaving to cook out. The lights were on, the volume was on max, and this fully charged speaker died literally within 5 hours! I'm not sure if the lights plus max volume severely drained the battery or what. I also don't like the fact that you cannot play music while a microphone is plugged in as it will disconnect your Bluetooth. Even with the mic plugged in, the sound from the mic is so low on this speaker that you barely hear it! There is no problem with the mic as I've tested it on other devices, the problem was the speaker. Overall this was a really bad purchase on my end. I bought this because of all of the positive reviews, and while I still respect others opinion on this product, I did not have a good experience with this product. Please beware that if you have or have had pretty good speakers in the past then this one will be nothing special.","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2022","profile_id":"AGTBCXX4ZU5X433XWCGO7OWQRS7Q","is_verified":true,"helpful_count":4,"product_attributes":"Color: Red"},{"id":"R32EPW7LR7IZ7M","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Sounds great and party mode is awesome!","author":"Jamie Morgan","rating":5,"content":"I bought two and use these at my pool.

You then need to make sure all the water gets out, and leave it to dry out for up to a week before it will play music clearly again. the first couple of days after floating it, it will not play at all, then slowly gets better over the next few days as it plays muffled & grainy. They manufactured this with a poorly engineered \"water tight\" cap that is easy to put on, but hard to remove, and doesnt keep water out anyway.

I purchased Altec Lansing over others because I have a friend who has had theirs for years with no issues whatsoever, he's had it in the sand at the beach multiple times and swears by this product. I just wanted to bring the issue to your attention as maybe it is a manufacturing defect.Upon having more time with the product, I have noticed when plugged in the power button is not lit up red, so it is not charging and at only 90% charge . Keep in mind this is directly taken from the box. I think I received a dud product.Furthermore I attempted to send an email to support@alteclansing.com and was returned an email immediately saying my email was rejected and unapproved.
