R2SSSH04J4J264,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice portable speaker for the price. Solid buy!,Bruce C,5,"Needed a new portable speaker for the home setup and once I saw that Beats (read: Apple) came out with the new Beats Pill, I bit the bullet and purchased one.First things first, the unboxing experience and the design of the speaker is quintessentially Apple. Speaker has a nice heft to it and the design of the speaker is really nice, with the angled design, and the speakers facing you.If you are in the Apple Ecosystem, this speaker was made for you as it connects to your iPhone the minute you turn it on with a very satisfying screen animation. I'm told you can easily connect with an Android product too but I didn't have one in hand to test out how easy it was.The sound quality of this speaker is really great for its size, living up to the Beats name, filling the room with punchy bass and crystal clear sound. Rated IP67 meaning it is dust and water resistant, so you can feel confident taking it to your next beach party or when you are traveling. Battery life of this thing is stated at a whopping 24 hrs. I'll definitely be testing that claim, but if true, is completely mind blowing.But what sets this speaker apart, and one of the main reasons why I bought it, is that it also doubles as a speakerphone!!! I can connect this badboy to my laptop, and take crystal clear Teams calls with it all day at work. And when I'm done with my calls, since it is connected to my laptop via USB-C, I can listen to lossless music on Apple Music. Mind...blown!Run, don't walk, to buy this awesome speaker!!","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFVM53KRAU5JC462ZZDBBKTESPGA,True,18,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R935PCZ92UVGL,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Very Happy,B. Hinson,5,"We bought this for a trip to the beach and it did not disappoint. Quick easy connection to our phones, good sound quality, solid build and long battery life. We have since found ourselves grabbing it instead of our existing outdoor speakers for using on the back patio. One feature we did not think we would use but really like is the speaker phone function. It is really nice for conversations with family that multiple people want to be involved in. Better then iPhone speaker phone alone.","Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2024",AFPN35SDBWBDQAGNSNQJQPQH5C2Q,True,0,Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R4BQHA0TLLJNN,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars The best Speaker I have ever bought in my life!,Leox,5,"I really like the new Beats Pill 2024 speaker. The sound quality is amazing with great bass and clear vocals. It's small, stylish, and easy to carry around, which is perfect for when I'm on the go.The battery lasts a long time, even with heavy use, and connecting it to my devices with Bluetooth is super easy. The design looks good and fits well with any room or setup.The only downside is that there isn't an app to control the speaker. It would be nice to have an app to adjust settings, check battery life, and manage connections. Even without this, the Beats Pill 2024 is a fantastic speaker that I highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2024",AEUCX7EIPTMCFN4OJBZHL2OYSVKQ,True,8,Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R39X7USU3OX34C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Really good,Justin,5,"So I’m super picky about sound and have spent a decent amount of money over the years finding good speakers. I was currently using the B&O Bluetooth speaker which is really good and is a bit more money than this. Prior I had Bose and some of other brands. Compared to all of them this is an amazing speaker for the price point. Bass is great. Clarity is great. Build quality is great. You can even hook it up via usb c to get lossless music. I didnt notice much a difference that way. Also if your in the apple eco system it works like AirPods where you can switch between devices and also locate the speaker via find my. Note I have also tried both of the newest beats over ear headphones and hated them, so I was surprised that this was as good as it is.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024",AFSZPNTTLYCLNP536L6VS6UMFTNQ,True,7,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R2EVRTXO9M1YF7,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Is it the JBL killer?,Tommy,4,"I bought this because it was on sale, and I always wanted a beats pill.I am a JBL user, and firmly stand by their quality and sound.Does this compete with Flip 6? Absolutely.Does it compete with Charge 4 or 5? Definitely not.Heres whySound: i purchased the Black Pill, right out of the box it is versatile in the sense it matches anything you have. I could’ve went with Champagne as well and would’ve also fit. I compared to flip 6 right away, it is Brighter, crisper and deeper bass at 50% volume and lower.However at above 50% the bass becomes muddy, it has this weird flutter sound to it. The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50% and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill.The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers.The pill is definitely very portable, great performance and most definitely great value for the money.Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AHAMVBSECCNUJMQV6A3BO3A3HNMA,True,5,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R3EOM3PFJ90D5Y,B0D4SX9RC6,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good design, but bass distortion",Daniel,3,"The new pill looks awesome, and built extremely well... The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs.... They seriously could've added a passive radiator to the back of this thing and then would have something here.... All this, and the package arrived with the box already opened.... not too excited about my purchase....","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHAIN2MT2BFGIAXCVJCMTI6NEDGA,True,6,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
RTDXQGCW5S0SA,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect,Scooley,4,"I bought the new pill mainly to use wired for my gaming handhelds ROG Ally X and Steam Deck. Most Bluetooth speakers today are lacking AUX ports and any type of direct connection. Bluetooth audio is delayed which is annoying when playing a game or watching a video.CON: Only 4 stars instead of 5 because to use this wired you need to hold down the power button when you plug in the USB-C cable, so essentially, I have to do this every day. It's annoying and almost was almost a deal breaker. I've just gotten used to unplugging it when I take my handheld off the dock, it's nice that it powers off immediately when unplugged, so there's that, I guess.PRO: The new Beats Pill sounds good, it's better than a lot of other Bluetooth speakers I've had. Being in the Apple ecosystem it's nice that it's interconnected with my devices. One not so well-known feature is that you can change the volume of the tones the speaker makes when it turns on or off. Use an IOS device, go into settings in Bluetooth and Accessibility. Having a low volume tone is soo much better!","Reviewed in the United States August 13, 2024",AHRRPRN7Y4X3UP2Z3YN6EWQJCUVQ,True,3,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R10YJBZGOB4SBS,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars No App for IOS. No way to disable loud startup/poweroff tones,Kindle in Hawaii,4,"Love these speakers, but Apple seemed to have made a bit screw up.The speaker makes a very loud startup and power down sound. NO way to turn them off.Also, Apple does NOT have an IOS version of Beats that will support the Beats Pill 2024. Instead, only supports the old Beats Pill+.Totally confusing! Big oversight by Apple. Hope they will get around someday to updating or creating a new app or just add this functionality inside the existing IOS to support disabling of these tones.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2024",AEF7JE6TACESBPXTYHKCLUEIJVFA,True,0,Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R2OYAX691GNN4K,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars One of the Best Compact Portable Speakers,Student Nurse,5,"I picked this up at the Apple Store the other day when trading in my old MacBook for the college promo (Gift card of $150 with purchase). With my gift card, I decided to inquire about the new Beats Pill that they have in store. One of the reasons I went for this item is because it was essentially free for me ($150 speaker + $150 Gift Card = Gift to me). Below is my review:Sound Quality: In the formative years of the Beats Pill, it has been a very popular speaker to consumers who are shopping for a unit that is under the $300 price tag. Just like the Beats headphones, this speaker is very well known to the general public & even further to the audiophiles (Like Myself). My first thoughts of the sound quality were “How is this going to sound?”, “Will this live up to its price?” & “How good is the build quality?”. Needless to say, when I got it up & running, WOW WAS I IMPRESSED!!!!!!This generation of Beats Pill blows every one off its predecessors in the water. The woofer alone is unbelievably powerful with the incorporation of newer & more durable materials. It reproduces great lows along with outstanding mids & highs. As for the tweeter, I believe this was also upgraded. The clarity from the tweeter is exceptional & performs well even at higher volumes.Build: The new build quality is MUCH more advanced than previous models. To start, the speaker is now on a(n) angle to promote better sound distribution throughout your space. The materials used to bring this speaker together feel very durable & solid. In addition to the new build, the speaker offers a plethora of other great features including a(n) IP67 rating, better battery life & a whole new look.Other Comment(s): The only comment I have about this speaker (Which I am sure is correctable by a software update in the near future) is with the on/off function(s). This was a little tricky for me at first, but I eventually figured it out. In order to turn the speaker on/off, you have to hold the power button for 1-3 seconds (I usually do it for 2 seconds & it works). This may be a turn off for some consumers as a lot of people today don’t want to go through the trouble of having to learn how to turn it on/off the right way.Overall: I would say that all in all, this is a great speaker for under $200 if you are in the market for great sound quality, portability & power. I bought the “Statement Red” as the ostentatious or loud red color got my attention & I loved it (I personally like speakers with crazy colors / designs). If you are in the market for one, either buy it here or check it out in person. Needless to say, you won’t be disappointed with this speaker.","Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2024",AFTRAIYZ5AITM2MEV2H2DNAHW73Q,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R3A0CT3JVYDFX3,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Bass Heavy,Geomancer,4,"As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AHS6VNLQVHWZLOI3RZ6ZXUWPK4OA,False,12,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R31FPPEOE54HHH,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad for the price,M.J. Shearer,4,"I own a plethora of bluetooth speakers, one even costing 10x this one. But, for a small portable form factor, this pill doesn't sound half bad. It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R1IDSWYH8GDHSG,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android,Alan,5,"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn’t say it’s the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I’m interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it’s sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It’s minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a “better” speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don’t complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it’s the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you’ll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don’t even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it’s kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

RCS6YZDDME20Y,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars The Pill punches far above it's weight class!!,Brian Severn,5,"Beats Pill (2024) is a high quality product, from the Apple'esque packaging, to the incredible sound output from this small [tiny?] Bluetooth speaker. Incredibly easy to use, connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races.This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can, albeit longer. It has a pre-attached teather that seems strong enough. Claims to be IP67 water resistant. It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB-C charging cable (USB-C YAY!!!). They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other ""party"" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest ""party"" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AGMUT4BKXZBD5PKSMOD2QHVHSKZA,False,1,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R2W2XN52WGT97C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you.

Even has different light modes, but for me, that is a useless gimmick. But for a party, may be a welcome gimmick.I've used this the last few months outside while working in the yard, and indoors- gym and while working in my basement. Cranked up, the sound fills my large yard and maintains sound quality, especially for a portable speaker. And no worries if it starts to rain, won't be affected. Nonetheless, I haven't attempted to test its full water resistant potential by dunking it in a pool or directing a hose on it (why?).In the house, at a ""normal"" volume, the battery last hours/days. So far, I have gone a few days of listening for a couple hours each without plugging it in. Also, it easily connects via bluetooth to my iPhone and keeps that connection for a range of 50ft plus. When I use it in the yard, I either leave my phone near the speaker, or I use my iPad or old phone to connect with Spotify or Apple Music so as not to be restricted to the limitations of Bluetooth range.","Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2023",AGA6WFKFQPYJ7QHSOTSHKQXXXD6Q,True,1,Color: Red

I use it daily for 6 to 8 hours and only charge it once a week.Having a dedicated bass speaker, I expected a better bass sound. At full volume, it's good but not great.For me, it's a ok speaker at the price.Would be a great buy at $100 but no more.If you want sound and flashing lights, could be for you...great sound quality, there are better choices for the price.","Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2023",AE2BXLCPCO3WZWJ5FF4JBU5S3NWA,True,2,Color: Black

The plug in area if it gets wet it won’t charge you’ll have to let it dry out really good. The one thing I’ve done is just seal that area up with ductape I know kinda lame but overall great speaker with some modifications lol.

The front facing woofers give you that heart thumping, rumbling sound and great quality bass. The sound is crisp and super clear with no distortion. Along with rocking sound quality, it's got 4 different LED lighting modes. You can set it to a slow fade, multi-color slow fade, solid blue or it'll beat to music. I wish I would've gotten a video at the party, but we were having too much fun and I forgot. It charges very quickly and you can get around 20 hours of playtime. That's insane!! You can charge it with the normal wall charger that it comes with or use the USB charging port to connect to a USB power source, like a power bank, laptop or wall outlet. You can also charge your phone with it while using the speaker. It'll connect to any bluetooth enabled device and has a 100 foot range. It's easy to pair and after the first time it will automatically connect to your device when you turn the speaker on. It's crazy, but you can connect up to 50 House Party enabled speakers at the same time. WHAT?!?! That'd be like your own concert. The functionality and options are amazing. It's even waterproof, so I can use it in my pool. That's going to be amazeballs this summer!!

But for me, this was the bad.The LED's that are supposed to give you a 'cool' atmosphere were defective on TWO of the units I tried. I went through Amazon's return process and received an identical unit with the exact same issue.When for instance cycling through colors, and setting it to BLUE, or RED; all of the LED's are supposed to be the same color.On both of the units I tried out, there was always ONE LED that was the wrong color. This may not seem to be a big deal, but when you set it to a specific color, and only ONE LED is a different color, it looks dumb. I contacted the manufacturer and was told it was most likely a manufacturing error. This is a shame, because honestly it sounded great. But my OCD couldn't handle there always being one LED out of sync with the others. Even setting it to multiple colors, it just looked off. I have returned my second one, and will be waiting a while before trying again. Hopefully others don't have the issue that I did, but if this would bug you, as it did me, I would wait and allow them to sort the problem out at the manufacturing level.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2021",AFSVVRABVIK2M3VSSHDBVYROL6SQ,True,5,Color: Steel Grey

It is very loud as well.I will give an update on the claimed ""20 hr battery life"" and the proclaimed ""waterproof"" and ""shockproof"" claims on the box.Also I feel that it should be mentioned that there is a 3.5mm audio out jack on this unit. This is an antiquated feature with the existence of Bluetooth but is occasionally a necessity as in the case of my budget screen projector which does not have Bluetooth connectivity. The box does not include a dedicated 3.5mm audio out line. It is just a nice additional feature that js not mentioned on the official Altec Lansing website description of the product. Thus far I am very satisfied with the product but will update as I use it.","Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2022",AF33Z7GLSR4FC7M6TZNCL3FUX22Q,True,1,Color: Steel Grey

RKXRR3FXIFUNY,B0BSNZJGTX,"1.0 out of 5 stars Were the reviews fake, or is my product defective?",Isiah E.,1,"I purchased the speaker in May of this year; hoping that I would not have to purchase another speaker for years to come. I'll be honest, this was definitely not worth the money and I'll explain why. The sound quality itself is lackluster. The audio clarity is just horrendous. I compared the audio clarity to that of my Amazon echo studio which I have as part of my home theater setup and the echo studio is far clearer. The speaker also isn't very loud unless you're in a rather small space with barely any people. This speaker wasn't bad for the game nights I hosted at my apartment but lord knows this thing is terrible outside, especially if someone else is also playing music on their own speakers. The battery life of this thing is severely disappointing. I might have only used this speaker a handfull of times since purchasing it, and I generally don't use it for more than 3 hours at a time but I put this speaker to the test on June 3rd as I did a cookout. The speaker with the lights on, only lasted AT MOST 5 hours! This speaker was fully charged before I used it, I even put it on the charger from the night before and only took it off directly before leaving to cook out. The lights were on, the volume was on max, and this fully charged speaker died literally within 5 hours! I'm not sure if the lights plus max volume severely drained the battery or what. I also don't like the fact that you cannot play music while a microphone is plugged in as it will disconnect your Bluetooth. Even with the mic plugged in, the sound from the mic is so low on this speaker that you barely hear it! There is no problem with the mic as I've tested it on other devices, the problem was the speaker. Overall this was a really bad purchase on my end. I bought this because of all of the positive reviews, and while I still respect others opinion on this product, I did not have a good experience with this product. Please beware that if you have or have had pretty good speakers in the past then this one will be nothing special.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2022",AGTBCXX4ZU5X433XWCGO7OWQRS7Q,True,4,Color: Red

I have purchased a few other speakers from this store and I really like each of them. This is the first bluetooth speaker brand I have owned that allows you to connect more than one speaker at one time. I love the surround sound option the music is crisp and clear. This speaker is much larger than I originally expected I guess I didn't pay attention to the measurements posted. It states that it floats in water however I will not purposely put it in water I am to afraid it will get damaged. I will be bring it to the pond with us every weekend so it may get splashed but thats about all I will allow. I love that the speaker illuminates the colors are so cool.

After a few minutes of floating the box will stop playing. You then need to make sure all the water gets out, and leave it to dry out for up to a week before it will play music clearly again. the first couple of days after floating it, it will not play at all, then slowly gets better over the next few days as it plays muffled & grainy. They manufactured this with a poorly engineered ""water tight"" cap that is easy to put on, but hard to remove, and doesnt keep water out anyway. Not sure why they didnt engineer a tighter cap with that could screw on with a sealed o-ring, it would be a simple fix and could make it a good floating box, but there you are. Also the device I received is definitely not a fluke or onece off defect.

I have a higher watt rating bluetooth speaker that can get louder than the RockBox but the speaker quality of the RockBox sounds way better than the other one from AOMAIS. RockBox can get still really loud if you push it to the max volume without having the sound quality wash out since the ferrite speakers can be pushed harder than alot of bluetooth speakers.

R2PF2WLR41KJR6,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for Audiophiles on a Budget,Caleb Roden,5,"This is the best speaker for the money out there. I have owned this for 3 years and have taken it everywhere, never missing a beat… (Yes pun)…The sound quality on this is pretty good out of the box but some EQ’ing on the app makes this really come alive with a vibrant sound. I cannot emphasize enough how much improvement a makes for this portable speaker. For me, this really loves a V shaped EQ as the mids are pretty forward and dominant out of the box. The hardware itself is great but the tuning is pretty average out of the box. If you don’t mind dialing it in yourself, it is well worth the 5-10 minutes it takes to set it and forget it. This has a pretty wide range for such a moderately sized speaker. This speaker boasts a generous capacity for bass and has excellent sound separation. It seems to have 2 mid-range drivers, 2 high range, and one “sub.” I initially used this as a little soundbar for my desktop pc but now it is my daily driver. I have used it nearly every day for 3 years and it has been rocksteady the whole while. The battery life is still excellent too.Back to the EQ, this benefits from a bit of extra sub bass, generous mid bass amplification and moderate upper mids and treble. With that set up, this little guy really becomes vibrant.Being a smaller speaker, the bass is obviously going to be somewhat limited but for the size it is surprisingly present. I would describe the bass as present, clean, and generally responsive.For durability I may not be the best person to ask because I’m generally pretty protective of this thing but it has been in a backpack hundreds of times and even dropped a few slight drops. Other than a small dent from one such drop there is no real sign of wear.All in all I would highly recommend this speaker for anyone who wants the best possible sound quality for the money!","Reviewed in the United States July 5, 2024",AGVTW4JTHAFPLMM6EQNFZ5XAL6IQ,True,4,Color: Black
R1QXBHCR4TIS7G,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Sounds very good with app/EQ,von Diesel,5,"Out of the box, the sound lacks bass and some highs. Downloading the app and tweaking the EQ makes these speakers really sing. I put on some Steely Dan and played with the EQ for 5 minutes and then they were good to go. They remember the previous EQ setting when you next use them, so you don't have to adjust every time.I bought two so I could pair them into stereo mode. They sound good and produce stereo sound alone, but two together is quite impressive.These are replacing an old pair of JBL Flip 4's. The Flips were fine, but the battery life was fading. I would use them at moderate volume about an hour per day, and I would have to charge twice a week. The new Motion+ are a bit larger, louder, sound better, and the battery life is 2-3X longer.Overall excellent speakers for the price so far. No Bluetooth connection problems and they seem to be solid and high quality. Highly recommended if you're willing to get the Soundcore app and tweak the EQ for a few minutes.

R3I7YEMYIPDPT3,B07P39MLKH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Speaker, has some fixable issues",CheezyWeezle,4,"The speaker itself is very good, has a lot of power for the size and I can usually crank it up to 100% without any clipping and almost no distortion if any at all (after adjusting the EQ settings... more on that later). The layout of the drivers and the fact that there are 5 of them in this tiny package absolutely fills the sound stage and the DSP does a very good job of balancing the power between them all. The battery lasts quite a while: long enough for a day trip or party multiple times over, and it doesn't seem to lose much charge when unused for a few days at a time. The portability is fine, it is a bit heavy and decently large, so you won't be putting it in your pocket and can't really comfortably hold it in your hands for more than a few minutes, but that's probably not what you would be buying a speaker like this for anyways.That said, I do have a few issues, some of which are major and should be extremely easy to fix (and I honestly am surprised that anyone in this day and age would leave these features out), these issues being that 1. Every time you turn on the speaker, it defaults to it's god awful ""Bass Up"" aka ""Destroy the sound quality"" EQ that makes everything sound TERRIBLE. When I first got this speaker, turned it on, and played something, I heard the awful cacophony and immediately turned the speaker off and put it back in the box, ready to return it. Then I remembered I read a review that said the default EQ was awful and that the app allows you to change it, and changing it to anything other than the ""Bass Up"" or ""Bass Off"" (Bass off sounds like the awful cacophony but without any bass) makes this speaker absolutely shine. The problem with this solution? You HAVE to have it connected to your phone, and you HAVE to use the app to change the EQ, EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU TURN ON THE SPEAKER. On the speaker itself, you can switch between ""Bass Up"" and ""Bass Off"", but you cannot set a default EQ, you cannot save a custom EQ from the 9-band custom EQ, and you cannot disable the ""Bass Up"" from being defaulted on every time you turn on the speaker. Because the speaker sounds so awful out of the box, I have given 4 stars in the ""Sound Quality"" feature, but if you change the EQ the sound quality goes up to 5 stars for sure.Another rather large issue is that it is currently impossible to use the speaker over Bluetooth with Windows 10. The device will only show up as ""Unknown device"" if it even shows up at all, and if you manage to connect to it, it will indeed name itself to Soundcore Motion+ but it does not recognize it as an audio device and you cannot use it to play sounds through. For me, this isn't a huge deal because I use the aux input when using the speaker with my computer, but I can image that this issue would impact others rather significantly.The other issues I have had are rather minor. For example, if you have the Volume Sync bluetooth feature enabled, you can only change the volume in it's predefined steps, so if one notch is too quiet, and the next notch up is too loud, you just have to deal with it and choose quiet or loud (If you disable Volume Sync, you can granularly change the volume through the Soundcore app, but then the speaker volume is independent of your device volume). Another one is that I feel that the rubber stopper that covers the ports has a rather clunky design, and while I appreciate that it is rather large to accommodate the waterproof feature, I feel like it sticks out quite a lot and gets in the way if you want to use an aux or charge it while you are using it. Also, I had a very bad experience with the firmware update, as it apparently must have at least 50% battery remaining (remember, it has a rather beefy battery and absolutely did not come anywhere near needing 50% battery, I'd say 15-20% is a more realistic limit) and also apparently takes an exorbitantly long time to update the firmware (about 15 minutes to install, I had already downloaded the measly 36MB update before it would have made a difference) while neglecting to tell you that it is going to take that long until AFTER you have already starting the update and cannot cancel it without risking bricking the thing. If I had any warning that it was going to take more than a minute, I would have waited until later so I could have used it during my break at work, instead of waiting for it to update.Now to round it off with a few more good things about the device: it turns on quickly and automatically connects to my phone instantly. It takes about 3 seconds to turn on and another second or two to connect via bluetooth. It also does NOT play any sort of sound when changing or maxing out the volume, a feature I absolutely despise in other speakers. You can also charge the speaker while using it. The Bluetooth 5.0 features are quite nice as well. The build quality is fantastic; it feels extremely solid and looks like it could take a beating.TL;DR: The speaker is great, sounds great, and has great battery life, but it has a few caveats in the feature functionality, such as poor EQ out of the box and a bug causing incompatibility with bluetooth connection to Windows 10.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2020",AFUPIW4BXLOBZXBG7CEP235UWBFA,True,15,Color: Black
RSATCQM413XZR,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars BT connection problem : But GREAT CUSTOEMR SERVICE & Problem Solved,Alex Y. Yoon,5,"UPDATE : 10/21/2020Problem Solved. Anker/Soundcore has contacted me and they have resolved the problem for me.A great company and products. As long as there is a good customer service and they can guaranty their products, I can buy their products without worries. Thanks AnkerUPDATE : 10/11/2020I have been using this for few days. Initially, I have connected to my 3 devices. my laptop, amazon fire and my cell phone. supposedly, when I turn on soundcore, it should be automatically connect to the previous device. That it does. however, the main problem is that while playing, the music gets cut off, trying to connect to my other two devices. So basically, either I have to turn off my two other device bluetooth features or keep reconnecting the main device which is my laptop to listen to music.I have many other Anker/soundcore bluetooth speakers but none of them has this sort of problem, except this Motion + which is very strange to me.so, I have to return the product and lower the stars from 5 to 1 stars.other complain is the bass. I am not a bass head, but surprisingly it does lack a lot of bass compared to my previous speakers, Earfun. Mid and high are pretty good, but bass is still bit weak.lastly, battery life does not come close to what it advertises. about 30% less than what it advertises.bit of disappointment.===============================================I always have been a big fan of Anker for many years. I believe that I have bought at least 50 products from them since five years ago. Before this purchase, I had Earfun bluetooth speakers. I bought two of them to use as stereo home system. They worked great and sounded even better.....for about two weeks and a half. then, one of them went kaputt. No power, no charging, just simply dead without any reason whatsoever.so, I had to look for another one.I always had my eyes on this Soundcore Motion + because of a lot of good reviews in youtube and I normally trust their quality and customer service.Fortunately, this one was on deal of the day at $69.99 So I picked it up right away.Just by the weight, it is heavy and I could tell that this has a lot of battery to play for a long time and it just felt good in my hand. Everything looked substantial and fit & finish was top notch.As for the sound quality, Yes, it is good. very refined high and clear mid/vocal along with decent bass. (but bit weak compared to mid/high)However, what made me to give 5 stars was the soundcore app. I was able to control the frequencies with my phone soundcore app. That was a huge point because not all music can be played at same frequency setting.However, I don't think that this motion + can produce 30 watts as advertised. it seems a lot low.....but it is okay. Loud enough.I know that it is the first day and normally I always am eager to put my review on Amazon. Just like the Earfun, perhaps in a week or two, it might go bad. If so, then I will update my review. But my initial impression is very impressive.Thanks Soundcore.","Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2020",AGGIR5S4YQMG4IKWU3A7K3BQ56ZA,True,4,Color: Black

R2QOAJU0QZKQ4P,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Such a beautiful speaker that sounds really amazing; especially for it's size!!!,thegrudge,5,"This is such a beautiful speaker that sounds really amazing; especially for it's size!!! I haven't updated the firmware on any of the 3 Motion Pluses that I bought or downloaded the app yet; so my review is what I think of them straight out of the box. Anyway, when I first spotted these things on Amazon, I just knew that I had to have one (and then 2 more after I got 1 of them).Pros:1) Really really great sound out of these things even with the BassUp feature ""OFF"".2) For larger rooms turning ""ON"" the BassUp features helps just enough with the bass in larger rooms without bogging down the sound.3) Tight punchy bass with or without the BassUp feature ""ON"".4) Mids & highs sound fantastic, very clear with great instrument separation.5) Pairing 2 speakers together makes these sound even better for increased stereo separation and fullness of sound—and the BassUp feature isn't needed as much when using 2 speakers.6) Beautiful design, it's the best looking speaker that Anker has made to date, in my opinion.7) IPX7 rated...so it's completely waterproof.8) USB-C charging and cable (I think that the first charging time on one of mine was about 3.5 hours but charge faster with a better socket adapter, or so I hear).9) Still has an 3.5mm stereo auxiliary jack and supplied cable.10) Battery level indicator shows up on my iPod even without Soundcore Motion application installed.11) Decent battery life (12 hours) however, one of mine, so far (haven't tested the others yet), has exceeded the 12 hour mark. I listen to it just below half volume and this is usually enough volume for me.12) This speaker sounds better and is louder than the Soundcore Pro (the most comparable equivalent to this speaker).13) You can turn the BassUp feature ""ON"" and ""OFF"" with this Motion Plus speaker but you can't do that with the Soundcore Pro.14) There is an application download for this speaker that I hear has some nice features on it but you can still pair it up with another speaker to get a right & left channel stereo paring without the app.—totally unlike the JBL flip 4s and JBLs which require their app to get their pair speakers out of ""Party Mode"".15) It's a little wider physically than the Soundcore Pro and the Boost so the stereo separation is still a little better than other models, even without having to pair it to another speaker,POTENTIAL cons but ONLY if these things are important to you (they are usually NOT a problem for me):1) Although, it has good battery life the Soundcore Pro (another Anker model) has an 8000 milliamp battery (18 hours of battery life) and this one is only a 6700 milliamp battery. It might have been nice to get a little bit of a bigger battery in the Motion but it's not that disappointing to me that we didn't.2) The Soundcore Pro has a standard USB port so you can charge your phone from the speaker. (This is not important to me as I would rather just carry an extra Anker battery charging bank to charge my phone rather than use the speaker's battery.)3) It doesn't have quite as much bass as the Soundcore Pro—if you're primarily into really heavy bass, which I am NOT. This is NOT a con for me personally because I think that the Motion Plus has the perfect amount of bass with or without the BassUp turned ""ON"". I found that I always needed to EQ down the bass on the Soundcore Pro to get it where I personally liked it. I don't have to do that with this speaker.4) This speaker is larger or wider than the Soundcore Pro and the Boost; so if you're looking for something really small, this speaker might not be quite as easy to carry around as the Boost or Pro. (This is not a problem for me at all though; I actually like this feature a lot.)5) No multi light battery indicator on the actual speaker itself—but the power button does start flashing red when batteries are getting low. (It would have been nice to have battery level lights on the speaker but I am still okay with it showing up just on the iPod and/or on the application.)6) Has sizable quantized volume increases for every click of the volume button however, these increases are NOT nearly as bad as the larger jumps in volume on the Soundcore Pro.Only 3 of these potential cons represented any problem for me:* the battery play time* no battery level indicator lights on speaker* the sizable volume increasesHowever, these issues still haven't seemed to have been that big of a deal so far because I get more than the expected battery time because the speaker is loud enough so I can just listen to it at lower volumes and get longer battery life that way. Also, I can track battery levels on my device and/or application so this isn't much of an issue with me. And as far as the sizable volume increase, I seem to be able to micro adjust them when using my finger along the slider (at least with the newer iPods and iPhones, older ones seem a bit more jumpy).Anyway, this is a really great speaker and I highly recommend it!!!NOTE: If you like your mids and highs scaled back some, then I would highly recommend the Soundcore Boost and if you really like a lot of bass with a dip in the mids, I would then recommend the Soundcore Pro. All 3 of these are good speakers though.","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2020",AGZ5Q5UNZ5WCHTCT5TX3DWABJIMQ,True,23,Color: Black
R19XDNHSZB3ZH1,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars The Audiophiles Choice,Russell B.,5,"The Soundcore Motion+ is an elegant design with excellent ergonomics that elevates this speaker above & beyond. It feels substantial in your hand and well built. The volume controls located on the top of the speaker are perfectly centered between the bass drivers on either side, and the front passive radiator which allows for easy navigation. Technically, the Motion+ excels with an AKM DSP featuring active crossovers for its four amps, each with its own dedicated power supply, silk dome tweeters (which I believe are Scan-Speak design), bass drivers with large neodymium magnets coupled to two passive radiators and USB-C charging. It’s a brilliant design that is supremely executed. Hats off to the sound engineers that collaborated on this speaker! Once you’ve unboxed and charged your Motion+ you’ll want to update the firmware and set up the custom EQ. To do that you’ll have to download the app. To use Ankers Soundcore App, you’ll have to accept giving up a huge amount of personal data analytics, so I chose to install the app on a tablet. Just beware. The Soundcore Motion+ will save your custom eq setting, however, you’ll want to delete the Soundcore app and re download it to verify that the settings are correct. The app will lower the sliders if they’re in between whole dB’s. Once it’s dialed in, you shouldn’t have to open the Soundcore app again. You'll want to refrain from pushing the bass up button on the top left of the speaker, since that bumps you off your Custom eq setting. The only way to get back to your saved eq preset is from the Soundcore app. I set the 9 bands of equalization all below flat to give the digital amplifiers extra headroom, keeping any audible distortion at bay. See attached photo. Since this speaker isn’t a three way and audible distortion is most prevalent at 1kHz, I set that band to -5 dB. Next is the lower and higher mid ranges at 700 Hz and 5kHz which I set to -4dB. 500Hz and 8kHz are at -3dB while 300Hz and 12kHz are at -2dB. Lastly, keeping the bass strong, I’ve set 80 & 150Hz at -1dB. So how does it sound? It’s airy and open projecting a surprisingly effective stereo image thanks to its silk dome tweeters mounted at the outside corners and tilted at a 15* angle. It’s balanced and capable with all genres of music from EDM to jazz, reggae to heavy metal. Horns, piano and vocals are beautifully rendered by the tweeters, juxtaposed by the bass capabilities of this speakers dual passive radiators. On Spotify, Amazon and Apple Music under shared playlists is my favorite titled:Epic House-Dance Music 4 The Soul.Some stand out tracks from Epic House-Dance Music 4 The Soul that sound fantastic on the Motion+ are:“Angels (Feat. Nora Jones) Thievery Corporation Remix” Wax Poetic- Norah’s voice floats around the room, amazing stereo separation. “Lips Like Sugar (Way Out West Remix Edit)-Echo & The Bunnymen- Punchy drums combined with some killer bass lines and melodic synth combined with sexy lyrics and a memorable rhythm guitar, this track sounds great blasted all the way! “Radiation Ruling the Nation(Protection)- Massive Attack. Even at max the on purpose distortion in this track sounds so authoritative! “I Want You (John Morales M+M Main Mix)-Marvin Gaye. This 9:36 long Masterpiece, highlighted by bongos, piano and saxophone are easily distinguished in the mix, throw in Marvin’s amazing tone, and man is this song better than the original? I think so. An analog 3.5mm jack is provided for those times when Bluetooth is not an option, however sound quality is best when left in the digital domain given the Motion+’s DSP. Speaker placement is important for the Soundcore Motion+ to sound it’s best. A solid surface such as a granite counter top, placed near a back wall, or corner placement can help accentuate the low end punch of the Motion+. A helpful hint is to hover the speaker in whatever area you’ve chosen and place the speaker when the bass moves your hand the most. Placing the speaker just inches one way or another can have a dramatic effect! This speaker excels indoors in moderate sized rooms, and can sometimes struggle in larger rooms or when played outside. The Motion+ puts out some serious SPL’s for such a small device. Have The Motion+’s USB-C plugged into power along with using the speakers volume control not the source device when you’re seeking the loudest output. The longer I live with this speaker the more I appreciate it. It’s an attractive design that’s understated yet compelling. For example, the power button glows white while powered on and changes to a blinking red when the speaker is running out of juice. In this state it automatically plays at a reduced volume until plugged in. Once plugged in to a charger via the USB-C port, the Motion+ increases in volume and continues to play while charging. Nice touch! I purchased a second Motion+ and my observations are that something magical happens with this speaker between the 3rd and 4th charging cycle. Keep that in mind when listening to yours. Critical listening should happen after the Motion+ is played for 30+ hours. In regards to Bluetooth connectivity, I highly recommend having a dedicated music source other than your phone. That awesome playlist playing from your phone while your phone is blowing up? It’ll be paused by the speaker from all the notifications.I modded mine, see photo, by super glueing a convex item over the bass up button, ensuring my speaker will always sound good! :-)The Soundcore Motion+ is a technical marvel of inspired engineering. I am consistently blown away by its performance. Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2019",AF67AQ42X5P3EYLUS6XXSDRTBORQ,True,166,Color: Black
R1CSRVU64OQJD8,B07P39MLKH,"4.0 out of 5 stars You have questions, I have answers",TazandSteve,4,"This is going to be long winded, but I'll likely answer a lot of your questionsMy intended purpose was to replace an aging Bose SoundLink Mini 1 that I was using for music in my garage gym. The SoundLink mini is an impressive speaker when it's size is taken into account. They provide a deep, full sound and produce great bass, but struggle when turned up much past 60% (at least mine does, but it is old). What I wanted was a speaker that could get louder while still producing a quality sound. I found that in the Motion+.When I first unboxed it, I noticed that it is heavy and has a very solid build. It is, however, it's not beautiful. The rubberized outside feels good and feels like quality and there are two rubber feet on the bottom to keep it in place.When first powered up you are greeted with the power up and pairing tones. They are honestly less annoying than others I have heard, though I know of no way to disable them.Pairing was VERY fast and straightforward and I can get a good distance away (I didn't measure though) without hiccups.It comes out of the box with Bass Up mode enabled. Listen... Bass Up mode sucks. It honestly should be called Treble Down mode. Yes it increases the bass, but not as much as you can in the custom EQ.I played a few songs in Bass Up mode just to see what I heard and as stated above, did NOT like it. I then played with the provided EQ settings in the app. I think if you are going to choose a canned EQ setting from the Soundcore app, the ""heavy"" one is decent. After that I played with the ""custom"" EQ settings and the speaker really started to come to life.Once you settle on an EQ setting you like, the SPEAKER retains those settings. So even if you pair it with a different device it will still play with your EQ settings.Now, I also have a built in EQ on my OnePlus 6T and decided to try that. First I turned off the custom EQ settings on the speaker (best way to do that is to hit the BassUp button on the speaker twice. Once turns on the BassUp profile and a second one turns BassUp off, reverting to ""bassoff"" mode). My OnePlus EQ has some ""general enhancements"" setting that I applied and I played with the sliders and it sounded pretty awesome. Then, I applied my custom Soundcore app's EQ on top of that and WOW! One EQ was awesome and two were even better.My next major test will be to try the speaker from different sources. I have access to a couple Samsung S9s, some android tablets, etc. I don't own any iPhones so I can't test that out. I'll update my review after doing more testing.I played with it for a few hours yesterday and even played it a bit in my car on the way to work this morning. I did find that the sound actually seemed to change slightly after playing a while. I don't know if speaker break-in is real or not, but I believe that the bass has become fuller and warmer after a few hours use. I'll update on this aspect as well.I am eclectic when it comes to music so I'll give a quick rundown of the types I've tried and what I thought.- Country music: I played several Chris Stapleton songs and I felt this showcased the speaker the absolute best. All the instrumentation came through warm and clear.- Heavy Metal: This is a WIDE genre and will likely be what is most often played on this speaker (it's for my gym, remember?). I found that ""industrial metal"" (Rammstein, NIN, etc.) needed a little massaging in the EQ to separate sounds better, but sounded great afterward. I ended up leaving these minor adjustments in place because they helped all the other music too. Atreyu, FFDP, Volbeat, etc all sounded powerful, loud and full.- Rap: Honestly, on day one I was ready to say that this speaker just sucks for beat driven hip hop music. However, after playing with the settings and letting it ""break in"" (if that's a thing) I was wrong. For example, I recently played ""come and see me"" by Ludacris which relies heavily on a bass line that varries from low, to really low with some thumps thrown in. I could hear all the deep frequencies, the slightly higher bass tones, and the periodic thumps moved my speaker. After that I threw on UGK's ""Gravy"" which also relies heavily on bass and it sounded fantastic.Now, how about that bass, since that's why most of you are here. This speaker is able to play really low frequencies, but it will NOT ""hit you in your chest"". You will hear all the bass, but you wont feel the bass... why? Because it's a freaking portable bluetooth speaker, not your home theater system, your bookshelf system, or your car stereo. If you want to FEEL the bass in your chest or whatever, you'll need to pony up for a speaker with enough size to resonate those sound waves. Doing so, you'll likely lose a lot in portability and whatnot. However, I have heard that the ""w-king D8"" is a good bass head speaker. Check out some YouTube reviews (or just order it, it's super cheap).Another thing to note is that the high frequencies are capable of getting louder than the low frequencies. As you crank this up, the bass will reach a point where there just isn't enough room inside the enclosure. People say you ""lose bass"" as you increase volume, but you don't, you just stop increasing bass at a certain point while the treble keeps on going. I've ran mine at somewhere near 90% volume and I can tell you that the drivers are still increasing their work, because the speaker basically starts having as seizure. It's just that there isn't any more space inside to resonate the waves.The reason, and the ONLY reason this isn't getting a full five stars from me is that my speaker farts. Yes... you read that right but only when cranked to uncomfortable levels and bass heavy music. There are a couple possible reasons for this. I could be asking for the passive radiators to do too much (I have two EQs, after all). It could just be the way it's designed (although I have read a TON of reviews on here and Reddit and never seen anyone mention this). Or my unit is defective somehow. Think about that last one though. If I DO have a defective unit, and my review is still this good, what does that tell you?I will reach out to Anker/Soundcore support just to ask some questions because their support is amazing. I've had other products from them and they provide the absolute best support I've ever received.To end (for now), this speaker really should be an automatic buy if you are looking for a portable BT speaker with high end sound under $100. If you are looking for ""slap you in the lungs"" bass, get something LARGER. I don't care what brand it is you can't get more real bass out of a package this size... physics is physics.","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2020",AHWVSZSTGXPDVPTOWARPP5H5QPQA,True,193,Color: Black
RNUN8GDHN4LUE,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars High-Res is a Gimmick. SBC only on Shield 2019 Pro. better raw than Sony SRS-XB32 though,SpeedingCheetah,4,"Don't fall for the label of ""High-Res Audio"" that many brands are putting on their speakers or headphones. At least Sony has grounds to say so kinda, as they support LDAC codec which is far better quality and resolution than even AptX.(LDAC 32bit/96kHz/990kbps vs AptX 16bit/48kHz/352kbps). And I don't think they mean High-Res for the AUX jack, as that audio is processed by the source DAC, not the speaker. This Anker does have AptX, but not the actual ""High-Res"" version AptX HD. (AptX has been around since BT early days btw. Since the very early 90's and AptX HD was out in 2009....and yet, u rarely see them on BT speakers despite their proven superior audio quality.I can get this speaker to connect to my Pixel 3 via AptX and it does sound surprisingly good for its size.It will only pair via SBC on my 2019 Nvidia Shield Pro. (SBC 16bit/44.1kHz/328kbps max)I tried a Sony SRS-XB32. That paired and used LDAC fine. However, it would have dropouts and pops every 30 sec or so.I have 2 sets of different Sony headphones, they use LDAC with no drop outs at all, but a Fiio BTR3 with LDAC that does cut out.I guess Shield is is picky.My main use for this speaker, is to replace a 10yr old Bose Soundlink 1 Bluetooth 2.0 speaker.I read this is a BT 5.0 speaker, and my 3 BT devices, the Shield, laptop and Pixel 3 are the same.I use this for my laptop(via Aux mostly) and recently my new Shield for late night TV watching when my large sound system is disruptive to my apartment neighbors or asleep roomates.Having 2 BT devices paired to this speaker at once(my laptop via BT and my Shield for example), when ever one devices makes a sound, the speaker will go silent for about 3 secs, then play the other source. It auto switching back to the other device it seems is harder for it as it pauses for much longer, 6 secs or so. Most of the time, i have to pause, or restart playback on the previous device to get sound to play. It is a little bit more gracefull when switching from the AUX source and the BT, but it still is a bit of a pause and fade in/out for a few secs. Best to mute or just disconnect the other source, to avoid your main source being interrupted constantly.The Bass Up default sound profile, is a tad muddy sounding, but had good sounding lows, for a speaker of this size. Turning it off, makes it sound too cheap and flat though. At least one can use the Smartphone app, (if you pair it to your phone) to use other profiles or a custom EQ. I am still playing with the EQ.Overall sound, i would say lacks some clarity and definition from the Bose Soundlink 1, but it has far better lows. Was hoping the ""tweeters"" this Anker has would be closest to the Bose, not quite it seems. (Bose does make very good products, but are overpriced. But i got the Soundlink speaker years ago at a Goodwill for $5...sooo....)Compare to the Sony SRS-XB32, which is a more expensive speaker, this Anker has better raw sound to me. Overall more clarity, definition, and more separation.Bass is tad deeper sounding up close, the Sony has a different design and seemed to output the deeper lows more front wise and could be heard better further away in that aspect. When using LDAC however, the Sony shines, despite the difference in no tweeters and different drivers. The Sony, however, only supports SBC and LDAC for some reason, so if i wanted to use my laptop via BT, it uses SBC. (The Sony also, if u have a AUX cable plugged in , it is locked to AUX mode, can't use BT unless you unplug cable...make it not usable for me.)Using the EQ in the Anker Sound core app, to make it more my taste, I really do like the sound this speaker produces, however, doing so, I can very much hear the poor quality and compression of SBC codec when playing music vids from my Emby Media Server from my Shield. Source audio files are FLAC or WAV. It really too bad this thing wont pair using AptX. Using my phone and AptX, it is much better sound. Laptop also will connect via AptX and sounds great too, but not as great as when using AUX of course, but, good enough that i may decide to ditch my Creative USB sound card that is eating up one of the 2 usb ports on the laptop.The USB C jack on this Anker is welcome, coming from a AC to DC adapter Barrel plug to charge.The top buttons are pretty much invisible on this thing. They blend in to much and are quite small, hard to find by feel alone as well.The power button on the side has a LED in it, so that is easy to find, but i would prefer power on the top along with the other buttons.Gotta give this speaker a bit more time to get adjusted to.It had a 15% off coupon sale when i purchased it here, so it makes it even more worth the lower cost than the Sony...but, it still is a disappointment for use as I mainly wanted with my Shield with AptX.EDIT: After a week of using this speaker, discovered some more quirks.The speaker does NOT remember the volume settings after you or it auto shuts off.This is especially annoying for use of AUX, as the volume is way to low and u have to press the Vol up button several times each time the speaker is powered up.The EQ you set in the app, does not function when using AUX.There is NO low battery notification at all. Only the power button LED blink red when u try to turn it on, then it turns off. No way to know the battery status while in use or at power up. (the Sony speaker had an option to announce battery level at each power on and, by default, had verbal battery low notifications on the speaker, several before it finally would die.) So unless you have this paired to a supported phone at all times and monitor via the app the battery charge, you have no idea on battery level. (those BT battery level in the phones OS is often very delayed and inaccurate in my experience with other battery powered BT devices)Battery life could be better for a speaker this size and weight. I have a much smaller Soundcore 2, and that is years old and lasts hours longer than this speaker. (Not a big deal for me, as I can just leave this speaker plugged into usb power from my hub most of the time.)","Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2020",AH7QQTSSML3TTGZK3PRZLC454YTA,True,54,Color: Black

R2XJD2H0R604QM,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars This speaker won, out of many - I LOVE this speaker",Michael C.,5,"As you can see from the attached pictures, I tested a good number of speakers. I was in search of a speaker around $100 or less that sounded good and would fit in a suitcase for airplane travel, and used indoors in hotel rooms and cruise ship cabins. I didn't closely check dimensions and mistakenly bought a few that turned out to be too large for that purpose. I was also targeting speakers with aux inputs and power bank capabilities so I would be able to use and simultaneously charge an aptX LL bluetooth receiver. This speaker didn't have the power bank functionality, but as it turns out, I don't need it (explained below).I have a choosy ear, and once equalized with the Soundcore app this Motion+ speaker sounded better at medium to low volumes than all of the others, including the Soundcore Motion Boom, and even the larger speakers you see in the pics. The sound out of the box was not great. The app's equalizer presets were not great either. I had to do a custom EQ to get the sound the way I liked it. The beauty with these Soundcore products is that the equalizer settings stay with the speaker. They are not specific to your phone. My only complaint with the app is that you cannot save multiple custom equalizer presets with the Motion+ like you can when using the app with the Motion Boom. Why the interfaces need to be different between the two speakers is beyond me.I do believe I noticed a difference with the aptX HD Audio. I could enable/disable that option in the phone's Bluetooth setting. With it on I can hear a little bit more fidelity. Of course, MP3s and streaming audio are not great sources for testing this sort of thing. I still heard a positive difference.HUGE BONUS (for me) that I didn't know about and don't see advertised anywhere on the product page. This thing supports aptX LL (low latency)! That must just come with the other Qualcomm aptX stuff. I use aptX LL to extend my whole home audio system to ""dumb"" speakers. I had purchased a tiny aptX LL receiver to plug into this speaker via the aux input, but now I don't need it!The Motion Boom was a close second, sounding better than the rest (once equalized) but losing to the Motion+ for my use case. The Motion Boom could get a little lower, and likely louder (not tested), but the Motion+ was punchier and had a better sounding low-end overall (once equalized). I'd say the Motion Boom is probably better for outdoor, high-volume listening. I already have a larger, less portable outdoor speaker that I'm happy with, so I returned the Motion Boom. I was disappointed that the Motion Boom didn't have an aux input, and I thought the soundstage was rather narrow with the treble changing pretty drastically as you walk past the front of the speaker. If I needed an outdoor speaker I'd definitely be trying out the Motion Boom Plus.I can't comment in detail on all of the other speakers I tried, but notable contenders were the Tribit XSound Mega which had surprising bass for its size, and the W-King X-10 which sounds pretty good loud but not so much at lower volumes. It's also rather large for a suitcase. The rest sounded like crap out of the box, to me, with little to no low end. Some had an app where I may have been able to make them sound better, but I did not try.I'm very happy with this speaker so far!","Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2023",AHHFOMVDJROC4MMFD23LOD5KDMOA,True,44,Color: Black

So when I saw anker get into the speaker game a few years back i figured it wouldn't be great - but not bad either. For the most part the soundcore line has been that, but has made considerable improvements over the years. some, like the soundcore 2 to 3 jump was not. the motion boom to motion boom +: Very much. I held off on the motion+ (this model) for a while and ended up getting it on prime day super cheap. While my wife wasn't happy to see another speaker sitting around... i sure am.Without seeming too full of myself, lets just say at 40 my hearing is well above that of a normal teenager let alone anyone my age. Because of this I've wedged my way into testing groups and other audio testing, my electrical engineering degree doesn't hurt either.. now on to the motion plus:its a unique size to be honest, its larger than what the price range would indicate, bigger than a bosemini for instance, smaller than an aiwa exos 3 but carries a price tag of $100-$120 USD which puts it into a questionable scenario based on suspicion alone. it has a weight that makes it feel well built, and a coating that to me says it doesnt. The coating is this rubberish coating that over time does wear out and become smooth (ala the soundcore 2 has), but its not a turn off. i don't expect an aluminum finish for these acoustics or price. The buttons are standard it seems on all soundcore speakers, up/down, bluetooth/tws, multi B button. this speaker also sports a Bass-UP button that i suggest you never use. it resets the EQ sound profiled to Bass-up and pressing the button again resets it to original. as features go, would be nice to see a scrolling EQ when this is pressed even if there is no visual aide to indicate where youre at. nitpicking folks, at its finest! Sound wise this thing shines. its frequency range is top to bottom for anyone to hear, and the soundstage disperses sound in leveled sweet spots from about 3 feet on a desk, about 12 feet out you start to loose the distinction but not the sound. this is above average for this sided speaker and i found myself using it more in situations where a smaller speaker wouldn't work. During my tests battery life was on par to what is listed as 12 hours, although like with all speakers the type and level of listening matters. I'm tempted to buy another and line them up next to my mid-sized go to pick, Aiwa's Exos 3... even though that device is larger slightly theres considerable comparisons. what might set the motion+ apart is its forward firing sub driver and open air port in the back, which puzzles me as to how it has a reflex port in the rear AND an ipx7 rating. you can bet im going to take this apart soon to find out... just as soon as i take a break from enjoying the sound of this thing during work. final conclusion is pretty straight forward, the negatives are few with the battery life being maybe, maybe a stretch the only down fall of this speaker. simply put, you will not find a speaker at one hundred dollars to replicate this sound. period. probably ever.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2022",AEU4QM6M252IYJLVIARY3YHJ3KHA,True,28,Color: Black
R104NRVAJCWY4K,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Inexpensive and Good Sound,DG,5,"I use this for computer and play from tablet while working. This is not a name brand like Bose, Bowers or Sonos. I have those as well. But a better value. The reasons are below after using for a while.1. Unlike others the multiple drivers produce stereo sound. The expensive brands BT speakers will tell you that it doesn't matter when two speakers are in close proximity. But if you are on a desk where the speaker is located, you will hear the clear difference a stereo speaker makes. You do not need to take the hassle of pairing in TWS fashion.2. Produces clean sound. I am not an audiophile but have decent ears being a former musician. Even the newer products from the company are falling for market gimmicks to attract customers. This is a slightly older model but still better. May be you get BT 5.0 instead of 5.3. I could care less.3. You can adjust the sound profile through the app.For the things I didn't like -- the USB and Aux input had a heavy rubberized cover that was unpleasant to move for charging and input.

R2Z4G7YU22UY5E,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Not good for stereo but decent for the price in a small speaker.,JD and MD,4,"Full disclosure: I am a musician and recording professional, so I may be a bit more critical or discerning than the average consumer. That said, I hope this review will help anyone else on a similar quest. I was on the search for a pair of bluetooth speakers to connect in stereo for use in our yard or home. I purchased 2 JBL Xtreme (first edition) at $150 a piece, so $300 for the pair. I had issues with connectivity and could only use them if they were within 5 feet of each other. The sound was decent and plenty loud, but too hyped up in the bass. They made a lot of songs sound muffled or too boomy. The JBL app has no options for EQ so you’re basically stuck with what you get if you want to use multiple devices to connect.I then looked around and found some great reviews on these Motion+ speakers and liked the price point, plus the fact that I could use a custom EQ. They also use bluetooth 5.0 so I thought it would be better for connectivity. So I ordered 2. Turns out stereo connectivity was only better by about a foot or two! Same issue as the JBLs! Dang. I guess that’s just what you get when pairing multiple speakers. I live in Portland, OR, so we are not rural, but our yard is a half acre and I didn’t think I’d have this much of a problem with interference. Funny how speaker manufacturers all advertise up to 30 feet, but have a disclaimer about it depending on other mysterious factors. Like living in city?The custom EQ was nice for the motion plus speakers, but with some caveats. First off, you are starting with a sound that is so boxy and mid focused, I just wonder what the heck they were thinking. With the default EQ setting, these were absolutely horrible sounding. By cutting some mids, I was able to get a decent sound (posted a picture of my settings) but still a bit boxy. The problem is, in stereo mode, only the master speaker changes with the EQ. This led to a lot of fiddling with connecting and disconnecting the individual speakers to try to get each one EQ’d the same as the other. After tons of back and forth I was able to get them sounding decent. I found cutting mids reduced the volume output, but sounded better than boosting low and high frequencies.The real problems came about when the Bluetooth connection started get really strange. Volume fluctuations and skipping like a cd that’s scratched. I had to leave my phone right next to the speaker to resolve the issue, but at about 10 or 15 feet away with no obstructions, there was definitely issues. I returned these after that, as the whole point was to have music filling up our large back yard with a decent sound, but have the phone on my person to be able to DJ tracks.I went to best buy today to try out some other options. I figured one bigger speaker would be a better solution at this point. The Ultimate Ears Hyperboom won...by a mile. That speaker is amazing sounding. Not sure why Amazon doesn’t sell these new, but for $399 that speaker kills the competition. My search is over. I just ordered one direct from UE.I feel bad for buying and returning speakers but hopefully this review will help someone else who is looking for the best sound for indoor and outdoor use. The bose pro system also sounded great but at $600 it wasn’t much better than the UE hyperboom....and with no 360 sound, I’d need two and I am definitely not willing to part with $1200 at this point and I want a more portable option as well.Good luck all you music lovers, and I highly recommend that JBL and Anker/Soundcore look into making something that will compete with UE’s Hyperboom. That speaker kills the JBL Boombox...and the JBL partybox lineup just sounds loud. No balanced sound, just loud. Sony’s lineup also sounded decent but a little lacking comparatively. If you’re like me, and like to hear/feel the sub frequencies, the Hyperboom is a clear winner. JBL boombox is next in line, but my wife hated the look of it.Long review here, but I saw there is a shortage of detailed and technical reviews for what I was looking to get, which is a big sound in an indoor/outdoor portable bluetooth speaker, for a reasonable price.","Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2020",AEZZMXVRUJAWYFY72SGSWECFPY6A,True,6,Color: Black

Very muddy sound,and super small sound window. It was like having a blanket thrown over it.After trying everything I could to fix it, I finally sent it back.As soon as I got the refund I ordered this, the Anker Soundcore Motion+, and waited impatientlyfor it to arrive and have now had it for a bit over 8 hours.I remember when I opened the Doss I was really surprised at how big it was, almost awkward.This was not the case with this speaker. Very nice package and a good weight to it.This thing is simplicity in it's self. Buttons are easy to find, just a momentary push on the powerbutton turns it on and into pairing mode. It starts in ""base up"" mode which was fine for me.Played my first song. Big smile, oh yea. Clear highs, very tight base that was clear and robust.Very nice sound stage. So I did the same thing as I did with the Doss, I took it all over the houseto hear how it sounds. Corners make this thing come alive. It truly is where this speaker wants to live.One thing I learned was that this speaker comes with the ability to play aptx and that Android8.0 or above has this option. This is a Bluetooth tech that allows the music to sound as much likeCD quality as possible using Bluetooth. Bluetooth data has to be compressed to send to the speakerand usually that causes sound quality issues. But this tech aims to fix this and seems to really work well.I then took this speaker with me to a building I'm working on and it's empty right now. It's a big100' x 100' building. It has a few small 8"" corners along the front of the building and I made that it'shome. Kicked up some tunes and got to work. All I can say is this thing simply blows me away in it'sability to project good sound even in such a large empty area. Of course, once I started using equipmentit cannot compete but dang. I would walk out and back into the building and it just sounded awesome.So, now for the only thing I don't like, and the only reason I gave it four stars.The app. Now the app it's self is not really the issue at all. It's the privacy agreementand all the things they make you allow to use it. It's off the charts. If you care anythingat all about your privacy then this app is a no go. And this is where things get ugly.See, you cannot update the firmware without the app. So in order to update the speakersfirmware, I have to accept some very ugly privacy conditions that I simply cannot agree to.Sadly, most people don't even read these anymore. They just click and play. No thought aboutall the stuff that is being sent to Anker in the background. And not just Anker, but all their affiliates.This is like a huge spiderweb of companies that we know nothing about.To get past this, I just installed it and then after getting the update, I just uninstalled it.It's weird, some of their speakers can be upgraded on your pc, but this one cannot.So Anker, please if you read any of these reviews, fix this so we can at least update the speakeron our computers at home without having to accept and agree to terms we don't like. Honestly,I should not have to allow you to have all that information just to use a equalizer and updater.So besides that one issue, this thing rocks like no tomorrow on virtually anything I played on it.And will be my go to portable speaker for as long as the thing will play.Thanks again to Oluv's Gadgets for reviewing this great speaker, I should have trusted your judgementin the first place.Enjoy : )","Reviewed in the United States August 20, 2019",AH5V4FGFB6RGWQGFJZAK5MGAHZUQ,True,31,Color: Black
R1EB8M1E8RTIXU,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Probably the Best Speaker for this Price Range,imyourpal,5,"I put this up for comparison vs my first generation JBL Xtreme and also the first generation Bose Soundlink Mini. Keep in mind that the Soundlink Mini is a smaller speaker and isn't necessarily in the same league, but price wise it is.Volume - JBL Xtreme takes it, Soundcore Motion+ comes in close second, Bose Soundlink Mini hard thirdSound quality - Both the JBL Xtreme and Bose Soundlink Mini had a clear emphasis on bass, to the point where unless you used a third-party equalizer it could get pretty muddy at times. Neither distorted at high volumes, but the DSP definitely showed it's limits. For a party, you might not really care, but for focused listening you'll notice it for sure. I believe that the Xtreme, while rated at 40W output, only gives 20W when played unplugged, but I could be wrong. Soundlink Mini has no wattage output as Bose generally doesn't provide that. Soundcore Motion+ has both speakers beat here - it's got a relatively flat DSP, and the app does have an equalizer that you can customize. Whether plugged in or not, it supposedly outputs it's full 30W. There's clear stereo separation on this speaker as well, and I think (but am not sure) that the JBL Xtreme has two tweeters as well. For this I'd go Soundcore Motion+ first, JBL Xtreme second, and Bose Soundlink Mini third.Size/Portability - JBL Xtreme is the largest but comes with straps, Soundcore Motion+ is second with no case/straps, and SoundLink Mini is smallest with optional cases. The Motion+ is actually pretty easy to transport in my gym bag and I definitely don't notice it there as much as the Xtreme. I'd go with the Motion+ for best overall portability.Inputs - All three speakers have bluetooth/AUX inputs, and the Xtreme takes it one step further with USB inputs. by sheer number of options, JBL Xtreme is first, followed by the Soundcore Motion+ as it has BT 5.0/USB C, and Soundlink Mini last.Weather-Proofing - JBL Xtreme and Soundcore are more or less tied here (waterproof/resistant, dust proof/resistant, have sealed flaps for the ports) while the Soundlink is meant for dry/temperate use only.Battery Life - Considering I've owned the Xtreme and the Soundlink Mini since they came out, their batteries have definitely deteriorated so they don't get the same amount of hours they used to get. I'd say that the Xtreme at it's peak gave me about 8 hours and the Soundlink about 6-8 as well. Motion+ is rated for 12 hours and I've been getting about 10-12 hours. Motion+ first, Xtreme second, Soundlink third.Charging - Both the Xtreme and Soundlink have their own proprietary chargers which can be incredibly inconvenient. Motion+ charges via USB-C and can be charged with some higher powered portable battery packs as well as wall warts, which make it the clear winner. The Xtreme does have the added benefit of providing power through it's USB ports which is handy in a pinch. You could attach something like the Moto Stream and run it off the Xtreme's battery while playing via AUX to have a better party speaker which is kinda neat. Motion+ first, Xtreme and Soundlink tied, with the Xtreme having a slight edge on being able to power other devices as well.App Support - Bonus or negative depending on your view. Bose doesn't have an app for it's first generation speaker so it's not considered. JBL's app is relatively simple, but doesn't provide any EQ for it's Xtreme. You can link another speaker to it, so long as it's supported by it's proprietary Connect... connection (note it does NOT work with Connect+ speakers, so you can't connect the Xtreme to the Xtreme2 which is a bummer). Soundcore app is simple as well, but includes a customizable EQ and allows for your speakers to connect to other Soundcore speakers. Overall I'd give it to the Soundcore Motion+ for it's customizable EQ.To me the contest is clearly between the Xtreme and the Motion+; the Soundlink just doesn't compare despite being priced similarly. I'd say the best overall speaker around this price range is definitely the Motion+ - it covers all of it's bases nicely and can match the Xtreme in enough categories while sounding better. If you can get this speaker for sub $90, then you got yourself a deal!","Reviewed in the United States September 30, 2019",AGIWDIAYZVC6JN52X4JMH3VXRUFA,True,5,Color: Black

R5YJ9IGH1AFCZ,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Love it but has annoying cons,Jon Rodriguez,4,"I bought this speaker after my tribit 20 to 30 dollar speakers died so I'll compare the anker with the tribit speaker.The anker is significantly louder, bigger and heavier. It has a led on the power button that is white when it's on or red when it is low on battery power. When you turn it on. It plays the usual anker jingle when powered on and off if you own any of their earbuds and headphones.What I like: it gets loud and it's clear. The bass is not feel it in your chest but it's pretty good better than the tribit for sure. I like the buttons on top, they are big and easy to press. The overall materials and heft to it just gives the impression of durability and good build quality. I also like how thick and big the rubber protector is on the usb c and output connectors section. Of course it's a usb c charging format.The middle of the road things:My tribit speaker lasted about 24 hours before needing to charge but would take 8 hours or more to charge. This one lasts for about 12 hours (haven't really tested it but seems about right plus or minus). However it takes usually 2 to 4 hours to charge back up so take note of that. It's not plug and play (I'll get into that in cons). Power button is smaller than the tribit and located on the side and not as easy to press.What I don't like:The bass button and feature is doodoo. It basically is there to make the default settings better which it does. However the default sound settings are horrible. This is not, I repeat not open up the box charge and play. You really need the soundcore app for this bad boy. It's vital that you go into the app and use the equalizer to make it sound good. Don't use the preset modes they are pretty bad too. there is an issue with that too. If you own any earbuds or headphones there are options to have multiple eq profiles(that you created) that you can switch between. This has 1 so you cannot switch between profiles depending on what your listening to which is perplexing to say the least. The other thing I don't like is the price.my tribit cost me 20 to 30 bucks. This shouldn't cost 100 bucks or 90 bucks at all. This should cost 60 to 75 bucks max regular price. It's louder yes but it really doesn't improve battery life, it's not plug and play and I don't care much about setting it up but just 1 eq profile? Really?In conclusion is it good? Yes. Does it have stupid cons? Yes is it worth full price hell no? Should you buy it? Hell yea but only if on sale not full price.","Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2023",AFSWTPDGR57E567Y5GSOJKRQUN3Q,True,10,Color: Black
R2G3VQW1K8ST8H,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Quality changes with complex music,AA,4,"Just like ALL devices with speakers, all the tests and YT reviewers all use SIMPLE audio to perform so-called tests… Providing the devices with the least stress possible.This particular device, actually does the best for its size with simple audio, HOWEVER with complex music such as Classical music or Metal, all the smaller devices completely fall apart. Why? The 2cent answer is because a piece of complex music requires reproduction of almost the entire frequency spectrum at the same time (think ALL the instruments at the same time), so that when a speaker’s suspension is moving to reproduce bass frequencies, it ALSO has to reproduce audio from a smaller wave at the center of the speaker… sound waves then crash into each other all over the place and this is called DISTORTION…The question is, does this one? At lower volumes, this SoundCore motion+ actually does very well, but this IS NOT for blasting, in fact I still have yet to come across another product of this size that does this well.As far as accuracy of sound, again, at low volumes it’s fantastic… at mid volumes it still outperforms everything in its size and price…If you like LOUD Complex music, there is NOTHING in this size that will do the trick.","Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2024",AEAN6TP6HQOIMBQELTJBK6ISXJWQ,True,0,Color: Black
R1B9GB35H5GHH2,B07P39MLKH,3.0 out of 5 stars Good but not great,RPG Fan,3,"Soundcore Motion + is much much better than our JBL Flip 3. it’s s good upgrade, but it’s still not great.-it’s good, but not great, for 80s hard rock / metal and guitar instrumental 80s shreddy stuff, but only at low volume levels. I rate it 3/5 stars for 80s Hard Rock / Metal.-IMO this is not worth $80 that I paid for it. I wish I would have spent a little more for a Bose or Klipsch speaker instead. And I would have only paid around $30ish if I knew how it really sounds before I bought it. The YouTube videos make it sound much better than it actually sounds in person.+It sounds much better with Rap music than it does for Rock music. I listened to some old school Death Row records Gang Related sound track, some Warren G Regulate, some DPG Dog Food and some and Daz Dillingers Retaliation, Revenge and Get Back (these albums are VERY bass heavy) and it surprised me on how good it handled the heavy bass. I rate it 3.5/5 stars for Rap *at low volume.*+The build quality is excellent. It’s big and heavy and not cheap and light. It feels real solid - like something that will never break. I rate the build quality 5/5 stars.+1980s Hi Fi stereos like Sanyo or Fisher had a incredible / great sound. Klipsch 2.1 speakers for a PC is an incredible / great sound. But Soundcore Motion + isn’t even in the same realm of sound quality as those listed above. it’s “good” at low volume before it gets muddy at higher volume, but it’s still only good and not great.-I had to install a Soundcore app on my phone to get it to connect, this rubbed me the wrong way.. It’s stupid and the EQ is overrated and is a joke.Overall I give it 3/5 stars, and if I could do it over I wouldn’t buy this product again.

It's just that, when you wanna win in the ring, sometime's you gotta go with a mid weight fighter, not the light weight.I will admit that I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to ""bass"". If I can't hear it or feel it, I'm left feeling empty. Especially at a lower volume setting. And, that's where the Oontz 3 disappointed me. Not so much with my new Anker Soundcore Motion Plus.I know, I know... it's not even really fair to compare the two because they shouldn't be in the same ring, throwing punches at each other. All I'm saying, is that if you want a bigger punch, with all of the flair included, I suggest the Anker option.Bear in mind however, that if you decide on the Motion +, you will surrender a round or two on the scoring card of ""portability"". Anker's Motion + is heavier and much larger. It still fits into my bookbag and laptop carrier okay, but there is a noticeable difference when trying to make room for it, and especially when lugging the bags around.With all this being said? I love this new ANKER speaker. And, I don't see myself ever going back to an Oontz Ultra. But, please remember that I am extremely picky when it comes to hearing AND feeling my music.

R35AC0QGDC97WW,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good but consider the EarFun UBOOM L too,TazMan,4,"The Motion+ is a very good speaker at this price range. To get the best out of it look around on the internet for some EQ recommendations to start with. Keep in mind that every firmware update can affect the sound quality.I honestly wasn't that impressed with this speaker out of the box. I got it dialed in much better by using the EQ in the Soundcore app but there are still some frequencies that are overboosted that I can't tune out with the EQ and since I am using an IOS device Apple doesn't give me anything that will work with Amazon Music.Out out of the box I'd give it a 5/10 for its size. Dialed in I'd say closer to 8/10. I bought the EarFun Bluetooth Speaker UBOOM L at the same time. Basically, no EQ options for it as it doesn't have an app. You can choose sound modes which are for indoor or outdoor which seems to accentuate or attenuate the bass a bit. Out of the box this speaker sounded far better than the Motion+. Even with the Motion+ dialed in the best I could with the EQ the Uboom sounds better. I'd give it an 8.5 or 9/10. The best I've tried in this size group has to be the JBL Charge 5 WiFi.It costs twice as much as the Motion+ or Uboom but I caught it on sale and it was very close in price to the Motion+. It also has the best battery life of the 3.The Motion+ is a good option. The bass lacks compared to the other 2 I've mentioned but mids and highs are pretty good but there is a sort of a peak around 5k that makes it a bit shrill. The other 2 seem to extend better into the bass area.I'd give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars. It is clearly one of the best in this size group. I'd put it a #3 cost no object. I'd put it at #2 if cost is an object. The Uboom is #2 for best sound independent of price and #1 if cost is a significant driver. Best sound is JBL Charge 5 WiFi by a nose so #1 here. I'd put it #3 if cost is very important. If you can catch it on sale, It would be a tough decision between it and the Uboom.","Reviewed in the United States November 14, 2023",AGIWD5JTRA54MGAL4GGQ34HWTIMA,True,2,Color: Black
R33VIU0WU1MBEU,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent, But Revision/Firmware Differences Limit Functionality",DMA,5,"I originally purchased this Soundcore Motion+ more than a year ago, and once I customized the EQ via the Soundcore app, I was super impressed with the sound quality. I never would have expected such (comparatively) impressive bass in conjunction with crisp, non-shrill highs from such a small enclosure. It has been a joy to use.After reading of how terrific these speakers sound when joined in pairs for the full left/right stereo effect, I purchased another from Amazon yesterday. Alas, after going through the pairing directions multiple times, I had no success in pairing the two speakers.In my research to find out the cause of the problem, I followed Anker's posted instructions on how to reset the speakers, delete the pairings from my phone, etc., but no luck. I then happened upon a post in Anker Community forum where the person had two speakers with two *different* firmware revisions, and they submitted a ticket to Anker to find out if the pairing should still work. Anker responded that: *no, in fact it won't*. When I doubled-checked my speakers, my older speaker (FCC ID ending in A3116) had a firmware revision of 45.xx, while the new one (FCC ID ending in A3116J) has a revision of 75.xx, so that is my issue. It is unclear if Anker would be able to update my older speaker's firmware at some point to match the new one, or if hardware enhancements might prevent this. Presently, though, I am unable to make use of stereo pairing of the two speakers, which is the entire reason I purchased the second Motion+.*Edit: I reached out to Anker support with this question, and they promptly responded that, yes, this is the case: the two versions actually contain different chipsets, and they will NOT pair with one another.****Edit: I originally knocked off one star for this issue, but I have now added it back, as I purchased another of the newer version speakers, and it pairs effortlessly with its twin. I will gift the older version to someone, since I don't need three units. They all sound wonderful, though.I would prefer that Anker make some distinction as to the different revisions of this product and perhaps add a disclaimer about the pairing issue between different versions. If not Anker, then perhaps Amazon could take the initiative and edit the item description. Should potentional buyers want to be able to take advantage of the stereo pairing feature, particularly if they already have a Motion+, I would recommend buying them in pairs to maximize the chances of getting the same hardware revision and firmware.Overall though, it's a fantastic little speaker with wonderful sound quality and sufficient battery life for my needs, and I would highly recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2023",AFEKQJBJSQZUOG54HQF6B7DBYZBQ,True,25,Color: Black

R2GH4AQZKUBPPH,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars For it's size, can't be beaten. One of my favorites.",David Bryan,5,"I am a totally addicted to Bluetooth speakers and to quality sound. For the most part, you get what you pay for when you buy speakers. In the attached picture, you will see a lot of speakers. There are pros and cons to each one and each one serves a purpose. Here is some of what I've found on each one:Aiwa Exos 9 - This is a great speaker for a party or for camping. It is 200 watts and has an equalizer so that you can get the sound just like you want it. It is very loud, but will distort when you turn it all the way up. It is too large and usually unpractical for most situations.Harmon Kardon Go Play 2 - I like this speaker for indoor use. It is 100 watts and has some deep low end sound. It is heavy and pretty large. The main thing I don't like is that the battery won't last more than about 2 hours when you listen to it at a decent volume.Logitech Boombox - I have two of these and they were my go to speaker for about 5-6 years. The sound is very close to the Anker Soundcore Motion+, but these are quite a bit bigger. Also, I think the Anker Soundcore+ sounds a little better due to the equalizer on the Soundcore.JBL Xtreme (version 1) - This is currently one of my favorite speakers. I use it for listening to music on the beach or around the pool. It has more pronounced bass than the Xtreme 2. It sounds great and has no distortion at full volume and it gets loud. The Anker actually gets very close to as loud, but the Xtreme maintains its bass at it's highest volume and the Anker loses some of it's thump at full volume.Anker Soundcore Motion+ - This is also one on my favorite speakers. I love both the equalize and the volume. It does not distort at full volume, but does lose some bass. It sounds much larger than it's size which means you get a very portable loud speaker with great sound. I am so impressed with how much power this smaller speaker delivers. It is very versatile and will work for almost any occasion.Bose Soundlink Mini II - This speaker is amazing for its size. It is great at lower volumes for listening at home or around a pool. It's portability is hard to beat and it puts out amazing bass for its size. It just doesn't shine when you turn it up as it loses almost all of it's bass when you go past 60-70 percent volume.JBL Flip (version 1) - At one time, this speaker was considered amazing. It is loud for it's size. These days, I'm sure the newer versions are much better when it comes to sound quality. I use this speaker for white noise when I am staying at a hotel or on vacation.Overall, my new favorite speakers are the JBL Xtreme and the Anker Soundcore Motion+. They are both amazing and the JBL is slightly more powerful. The Anker's size, weight, equalizer and power make it more portable/convenient for most listening situations. In all of my years of buying speakers (and I own a lot more than just the ones in this pic), I haven't found a better value for the money.

R56I69OFW1W11,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Hail ! The New Junior Welterweight Champ!!!,Gerald S. Brady,5,"I know a lot about and own several Bluetooth speakers. I own I think the largest ""party speaker"" that Anker makes the Rave, which is a very excellent product. I also own a W-King, also a very excellent product. I was using my W-King on my nightstand about 2 feet from my head. I had acquired a desire to upgrade the W-King with something perhaps more elegant and smaller and less utility looking. Eureka! I happened upon this heavenly creature of a Bluetooth speaker. The W-King currently costing $75 dollars is still the best bang for $75. If You are not so poor that you can't squeeze another $25 dollars out of your wallet, I very strongly suggest that you pull those rubber bands from around you wallet, let those moths escape and kerplunk down $100 and buy this box instead. I used my W-King as a reference point in my quest to hopefully replace it. The Motion+ is half the size of the W-King and sexy. It has the build quality and appearance of an Apple product ( Dr. Dre. Pill on illegal steroids.) Hold on to your hat ....... although smaller, this thing plays louder and clearer than the W-King, I mean actually. If I had not myself purchased this and blindfold tested this, I would swear that I was hearing a Bose Wave CD player. I had considered buying a second Motion+ but decided not to. Unless you have to realize the added dimension of stereo you'd be make something that sounds really good, sound really good and loud. I don't need that in my life. A second one of these would be a waste of money as you would always be listening to the two at a low volume setting. (Two of these could work out for you if you throw parties. Your guests would be wondering where is he hiding his towers and subwoofer ?) Thank You Anker !!!! This is a revision to my prior review. I previously stated that owning two of these would be a waste of money. At this time I would like to retract that statement as nonsense. I took the plunge and bought a second Motion+. My position on the matter now is that two of these make something that sounds good, sound better (probably something to do with increased power bandwidth using two). I have these installed on either side of my headboard. I sleep literally bathed in hi-fi. I sometimes sit on the other side of the room astounded that that sound is coming from those tiny drivers and passive radiators, (A coup de gras for Anker research & development and engineering.) However I should point out as some other reviewers have there. is a problem sometimes with bluetooth connectivity. I choose to call this phenomenon ""line of sight radio wave interference"". If you learn to live with this system, the problem will loom as minuscule. Also some reviewers have complained about the sound quality. I could only imagine that these people do not or don't know how to use the included Soundcore equalizer. ( With this, and any audio system a graphic equalizer is essential to optimize performance and sound quality.) Using Anker's or any good equalizer app plugin I can find nothing wrong with the sound of this box. ( What doe's anyone require from a box that's 9.5 by 3 inches and cost one hundred dollars and has a battery and is portable, and fits in your pocket if you wear a big coat ???!!!). Thank you Anker.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2020",AHC5KODBOLAH3V62W4MMUSNOH74A,True,2,Color: Black

RT179HSU7O04H,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Competition to more expensive brands,Basilisk,5,"I was actually looking to buying similarly sized JBL speaker in my local shop.Luckily, done my research before doing that.JBL - no aux, very basic BT format SBC, rudimentary app, well extended and slightly uneven FR, sounds ok in person besides weird grain somewhere in highs, around 10Hz better bass extension. Price is 3X.Motion Plus - AptX HD and low latency mode, aux in, which I use a lot, can be connected to both my and my gf phones at the same time, 9 band EQ, a bit smaller than JBL, fits my hand well, wide sound dispersion, ok and easy to EQ stock sound and all that while being 70-80 bucks. No brainer.Sound.Sine sweeps by ear subjectively correlate with dips and peaks in RTings measurement from 400Hz and up.Some of FR unevenness can be addressed by EQ in Anker's app, though 4-6 band parametric EQ will solve all the major issues.EQ preset on my screenshot is made on the base of BassUP preset to make the stock FR closer to flat.Removes shouty peak at around 3KHz, zingy peak at approx. 5KHz, fills in some lower treble and air.Values in Db differ from what may appear reasonable by RTings graph - they're adjusted accordingly to my subjective perception during sine sweep runs (for instance, I pushed 2.5KHz down lower, then it ""supposed"" to be accordingly to graph).You can easily adjust value in Db to flatten FR accordingly to RTings graph.Stereo mode.It exists, it works and it is very easy to setup, which is awesome. I wasn't testing it thoroughly, but in my case there is a delay in starting the playback, so first couple of seconds of song are omitted.Since stock frequency response is still very decent, app is great and price is low, motion plus makes a great gift.

R2IIVN3WSFIFI,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Wow! Soundcore Motion+ vs JBL,Tammy W.,5,"I have to say, as far as bluetooth speakers go, I've always been a big JBL fan. I've had a JBL Xtreme, Flip 3, Flip 4, Clip 2 and Clip 3. Recently my Flip 4 battery began to die so I started researching replacements. My natural inclination was to get a Flip 5, which I did order from Amazon and eventually used for a comparison with the Motion+. I watched a bunch of You Tube video comparisons each proclaiming how good the Motion+ is. I also read a ton of comments on Amazon so I decided to order it. This thing is unbelievable for a $100 speaker! I have to say I was a bit skeptical, but it really lives up to all the positive ratings and comments. Based on the sound comparison with a Flip 5 (which may or may not really be fair), it blew the Flip 5 away. Probably a JBL Charge 4 or 5 would be a more fair comparison, but I don't have one so I can only speak to what I could actually compare. What I noticed: 1) Clarity - incredible clarity even at high volumes. At around 75-80%, JBL began to lose some clarity. Motion+ was still clear as a bell. 2) Stereo! JBL doesn't to my knowledge have any true stereo speakers. Motion+ actually plays in stereo (yea!) 3) Amazing bass for its size. It's not going to give you the same level of bass as, say, a Bose S1 Pro (which I also have), but you can't expect that it will. However, for its size, the bass is punchy, deep and clear. Make sure to use the bass boost function. 4) There's an equalizer app available for Android or iPhone. What a nice feature! 5) Other nice features: IPX7 water resistant and rugged shell - just like JBL. If you're looking for new speaker or even your first one - definitely at least give the Motion+ a try.UPDATE: I recently got my hands on a Bose Soundlink Color II and did a sound comparison. The Motion+ blew the Bose out of the water. I'm always tempted to try something new and see if it beats the Motion+, but so far nothing near this price can compare.Another comparison: I tried the Motion+ against the new Bose Soundlink Flex. While the actual sound of the Bose was superior and had some nice punchy bass, the Motion+ was louder and still held its own to the Bose. Morion+ wins it for outdoor use for sheer volume. I do think the Bose Flex wins for sound clarity and smoothness and would probably be better for indoor use.Update 7/23/2024: I just ordered another Soundcore Motion+ to pair two of them together. I'm very disappointed that you cannot pair on older version Motion+ with the new version. Soundcore: please fix this! In the meantime, I'm sending the new one back. My old one is still going strong after 3 years!","Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2021",AH6EWYO4Q4Y5DBPVIUT2NWNQZKOQ,True,9,Color: Black

R36KTVX5KXGTOK,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound for the price, but not the most portable speaker",Zachary G. Robbins,5,"I have been using the Anker Soundcore 2 for years. While that is perfectly acceptable for listening to podcasts indoors, the sound quality is lacking for music. And it's not loud enough to use outdoors without significant distortion. In the last year I've shifted back towards more music listening, and needed a speaker upgrade. There are a ton of options, and you could spend a lot more money if you wanted the absolute best sound quality. The reviews for the Soundcore Motion+ were generally good to very good, so I took a chance because I've had a great track record with Anker products. The other options I considered were the JBL Flip 6, JBL Charge 5, Ultimate Ears Boom 3, and Bose SoundLink Flex. I'm listing these for reference to the price range, quality, and size I was looking at before purchasing the Soundcore Motion+.Pros:-Overall excellent sound quality. I have never been one to buy the best quality speakers, but this sounds significantly better than the small speakers I've gathered over the years and probably better than my Subaru Crosstrek Sport 2021. It is not as good as my old school Aiwa and Sharp 3-piece stereo boomboxes, but it's pretty close. For reference I mostly listen to metal and rap, and I judge sound quality on how my favorite metal bands sound on different speakers.-The form factor is rock solid and sits flat. It's going to be more stable than other options that are more cylindrical and especially the speakers that sit upright.-Directional speakers over the wraparound style. I want a speaker that directs sound towards me and doesn't fill the room, especially at work.-Battery life is excellent. It is listed as 12 hours but I think it's quite a bit more. Technology websites have tested it being closer to 16 hours.-USB-C charging and Aux ports. These days it's hard to find Aux ports on speakers. If you have an old iPod like me then it's nice to have that Aux option.Cons:-Heavy and bulky compared to other options in this price range. I have no problem grabbing the Soundcore 2 to move it around the house or between labs and offices at work, but the weight of this makes me think twice about casually grabbing it.-Charging is slow, longer than I'm used to with the Soundcore 2 and other small electronic devices.-Minor quibble, I wish all of the buttons are a little bigger.","Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2023",AEWIZKAI3H4NTZISXLY4U3HUFH4A,True,11,Color: Red

R1TDNL0MLH7I97,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Great speaker for small spaces,R. J. Reding,4,"My nearly 20 year old Bose Sounddock finally died and I was looking for replacement with good sound and small size. The Anker Soundcore Motion Plus has been a great replacement. I believe the sound is equal to my old Bose. I had purchased a small Soundcore 2 several years ago for use on my patio and travel and was very impressed with the sound. This Soundcore Motion Plus has an even more solid bass and clear treble and is a perfect size for our small living room. The bass boost is solid and with 30W of power should fill most spaces with thundering volume. Two devices can be linked for a true stereo effect, but for a small room the sound experience with a single unit is excellent The device is water and splash resistant for outdoor use, but gives piece of mind for use in my living room where spills from cats and grandkids are possible or if I wanted to take it to the kitchen. It would also be perfect for use at your cabin or on your deck or patio. The exterior does have a rubber like coating, but comes in several colors that look fine for your indoor spaces.There are a couple of small issues. Because it is battery powered you will have to physically turn it on to use it. Battery life is quite long, but It will turn off automatically when not in use with an auto shut off feature that can be adjusted via a phone or tablet app. It would have been ideal to have it turn on via the phone app or through an Alexa voice app. The manual that ships with the device is useless pictograms. Fortunately I was able to find a written owners manual online and one is available with the phone app. The equalizer on the phone app only allows you to turn the bass boost on or off. It would have been nice to have actual equalizer controls over a range of frequencies or preset equalizations for music or room type. However both my Android phone and an Alexa app have equalizer features. Aside from the pictogram quick guide set up was easy and the Bluetooth sync was without problems for both my phone and Alexa. The app also allows for firmware updates, but also includes push notifications. The device also supports the latest Bluetooth codex, though your connected devices may not offer that higher standard e.g. generation 1 and 2 Alexa devices. The speaker can however be directly connected with aux line in with an included cable.Overall the Anker Soundcore Motion Plus was exactly what I was looking for and at the price I wanted to pay. Given my good experience with my Anker Soundcore 2 speaker I would expect this product to be equally trouble free.","Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2022",AF6SON7PE54ISGTP7IWKTUBIFLXQ,True,1,Color: Black

As of right now, I don’t have anything negative to add.*I am admittedly and audiophile- very particular about equipment and sound*I will update my review in a month to let you know how it’s going***UPDATE***05.26.21I HIGHLY recommend getting the free Soundcore App for adjusting the EQ, as it makes a huge difference. The speaker is very responsive and much improved with the App / EQ. If you aren’t savvy with the EQ, there are a few “sound maniacs” on YouTube that can walk you through how they have it set up and they are great!I really have enjoyed this speaker. I did a blind sound comparison between my new Apple HomePod and my Soundcore Motion+…with my wife, a couple of buddies, and myself. They both excell at different things- (highs, mids, lows)…but the overall SQ between the Motion+ and HomePod was pretty much a toss up. Also convenience wise, the Motion+ beats the Apple on several fronts (and I have an iPhone LOL). Keep in mind the the HomePod is $300 and the Motion+ is $100. Im liking the Motion+ so much that I ordered another one and paired them together. I tried to do this on my own but couldn’t quite figure it out. I called customer service and a rep answered my call right away, was very professional and walked me through it. As much as I enjoyed the 1 speaker, having 2 of them synced together sounds VERY VERY VERY nice! I enjoy this set up so much that I decided to return my Apple HomePod. I have nothing negative to say about this Soundcore Motion Plus! Get it, get the app, and if you have $200 to buy 2 of them…DO IT. You’ll be quite blown away with the SQ for $200. If you don’t have the cash for two, one Motion+ is plenty good for most people. Again, I’m a bit of one of those “sound maniacs” or audiophiles. I’ll just throw one more thing in- the build quality on these guys are SOLID! I’m a very happy customer. 👍🏻 I buy a lot of shizzle on Amazon.

Back then, the battery life was acceptable, but I don't think it was ever near 12hours like advertised. Maybe half that, maybe a bit less. Not a biggie. However, in my attempts to have one bluetooth device for each PC / phone that played audio to avoid the struggles of trying to determine which device was taking over which bluetooth device, I started using this again.Battery life now is about non-existent. I don't have exact figures, but I expect it's easily within an hour it dies if not plugged in when in use. I basically have to leave it plugged in, which works for its use case, but not ideal. I have a lot of Anker products in my shopping history here going back almost 10 years. A large number of those products are in use today still. Possibly I got a dud here.

Very little distortion at higher levels. I had a few connectivity issues until I got the hang of it, but everything is jake now.I had a pair of the equivalent ($99) Bose wireless portable speakers and returned them for these.Anker vs. Bose comparison:* Sound is superior in Anker speaker. Bose does offer the choice of mono or stereo sound.* App needed to pair Bose speakers. No app needed to pair Anker speakers.* Once Anker speakers are paired, they stay paired when you turn the speakers on again. No need to re-pair as with Bose.* Anker has an equalizer function to customize music. Stays at the setting when turned on again.* When the Anker speakers are paired, when you turn one off the other shuts off as well. Bose speakers must be shut off individually.* When music is paused, the Anker speakers stayed powered up for much longer than the Bose speakers, roughly 20 vs. 5 minutes. With the Bose I always felt that if I left the room for a couple of minutes, I had to open the app again and re-pair the speakers.One item to note--when I first got the Anker speakers some songs started half a second into the song intro, a semi-annoying problem I once had with a pair of earbuds. However, that issue seems to have resolved itself.The sound between the Anker speakers will ""drift"" from time to time. That is, sound will fade in one of the speakers and increase in the other for a second or two before equalizing again. Happens occasionally and is not annoying enough to put me off the speakers.I would have preferred a vertical rather than a horizontal orientation, but the Anker speakers are very solid and portable. I love to move them around the room so that no matter where I am, I am perfectly between the two speakers.There's something about the speakers that make the music very comfortable, almost soothing, to the ears. I I never want to turn them off.I had a pair of the equivalent Bose speakers and returned them for these. A friend of mine did the exact opposite, but that's because she wanted the mono sound option in the Bose.

Reddit actually led me to find this speaker.Pros:Budget. As it was on Sale for $85 versus a charge 5 at roughly ~160, and everything else far above thatSound( with tweaking). The audio out this thing is amazing. Not life changing. Not ridiculous. But as someone who primarily listens to hip-hop, jazz, and r&b, this speaker in it's 6-8 hours of usage already has blown me away. It gets loud. It has crisp bass, decent mids, and pretty clear highs. For the price range this is what I've come to expect and it has matched expectationsPairing. By holding Bluetooth you can pair two of these speakers together and this naturally offers double the amazing sound and you can truly fill a bedroom with music. I'd compare the experience to having a massive soundbar (like an entire walls length) with a mini subwoofer. It's actually an incredibly immersive experience. And once again, the price of this thing means buying two might not hurt your bank terriblyVolume. Even with a singular speaker I can easily fill my bedroom with more than enough sound. In a masterbedroom, half the room is drowned with music and the other is conversation level.Cons:Battery. The battery at 75-100% volume will die at roughly 4-6 hours. I've had two sessions on one battery session right out the box before resorting to charge. That's not terrible to be honest but worth mentioning as a conMax Volume Sound. You are going to sacrifice some quality of sound as you increase volume pass 75-80%. I don't notice distortions, but the bass actually gets outpowered by mids and highs which slap out, for lack of better terms.

Loved it so much I added another!,Bryan A,5,"I've owned a number of Bluetooth speakers in my life and my complaint is usually the same on anything that doesn't include a high price tag. Most are muffled, lack clarity, and are particularly bad on the low end. I've read the countless reviews on the Soundcore Motion+ and finally decided to try it out. I'm very glad I did as it's by far the best smaller Bluetooth speaker for the price or less that myself or friends have enjoyed.Pros:-Sound quality is very good for what I listen to and I listen to a lot of genres of music, movies/shows, and racing.- I love the size and weight of it. It's built very well. (It might be a bit too large/heavy if you like small ultra light weight speakers)- Bluetooth connectivity has been excellent, the app works great, I really like the stock EQ settings as well as the custom EQ.- Value compared to the well known name brands is exceptional.- I love the rubber on the top and bottom of the speaker. On slippery surfaces it grips well and on the top it's a nice soft touch. The top does show fingerprints, but those are really easy to clean off. I prefer that to just plastic or cloth by far.- I've not had it out in the direct rain, but I've had it out in very high humidity conditions and have spilled water on it and it didn't affect it at all. It just made it easier to clean.- The 15 degree angle of the speaker is awesome if you're sitting down or standing up. It definitely makes a difference if you have it lower than ear level listening.Cons:-I wish it had a mute button-I wish it had a battery life indicatorNeither con is enough to deduct a star from it though. You can obviously mute it from your device or see the battery life in the app, but when I'm full screen watching something live it would be nice to easily see battery life or mute on the device itself, especially when I have it hooked up to my mini PC. On a phone or tablet that is in your hand or right next to you then it's not a big deal at all.Overall this speaker is flat out awesome. I'm very happy with my purchases and I look forward to seeing what Soundcore can come out with in the future. A larger version of this with some more low end bass would be the best of all worlds in my opinion! I just wish I wouldn't have overlooked it for so long, because it wasn't a big name speaker brand.

R1XARHZH2G2SE6,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars AMAZING for electronic music,Kyle Archer,5,"A disclaimer: I use this speaker with Android and use only FLAC audio files which means I'm taking full advantage of the AptX Bluetooth codec. If your phone doesn't support AptX (like an iPhone) I wouldn't recommend the Motion +. Find something that supports AAC instead.Ok, so I'll be honest. I don't care for this speaker for rock music. That's my big criticism. The rock I listen to is heavily layered and drenched in distortion and reverb. Think ""wall of guitars"" style. In other words the sound is huge and occupies the whole spectrum as a sort of singular mass of sound. My Galaxy Buds + handle this perfectly but The Motion + seems to have a hard time and the sound is unbalanced, like the speaker is trying to emphasize a certain frequency that doesn't make sense for this music. Random frequencies of guitar distortion are elevated and it sounds really off, even after playing with the EQ setting.However for anything electronic I've found this speaker sounds absolutely stunning and it seems to me that's what the Motion + is geared for. The clarity is unreal, especially for a Bluetooth connection. I listen to everything from heavy bass EDM to rich, ethereal ambient music. With the bass heavy EQ there is a massive bass presence but it remains a refined, tight sound instead of a muddy boom like many other Bluetooth speakers. The mids retain clarity and punch despite the bass and the treble is clear as glass. All in all the sound is incredibly high quality and perfectly balanced but again, just for electronic music in my experience. This doesn't bother me too much because this is primarily what I listen to but many people aren't into electronic so I thought I'd state this for fans of rock and metal. Another thing to mention is the overall presence of the music. I can flip this speaker around to face the wall and it still somehow fills the room with crystal clear sound. The battery life is very long, charging happens pretty quick, and the aethetic of this speaker is just as appealing as everything else.To recap: If you're an Android user and you love electronic music just buy this thing. You'll be blown away. For everyone else though I'd say there are much better options out there.","Reviewed in the United States May 14, 2022",AF33Y2RIQHKDYOUV2QAUIFIZZYTA,True,3,Color: Black
R31ZMRWYQKIQ64,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Loud and Clear,Mark,5,"My old 12 watt Anker Soundcore was too quiet for some audio books. I drive endless hours over the highways delivering your food to distribution centers. Headsets are seen by the DOT at the pre-clearance sites with those big cameras looking right inside the cab of the truck. Also even the bone induction headsets cause an achy soreness after a few hours so a Bluetooth speaker is essential for listening when the truck radio's Bluetooth auxiliary is bad. This new 30 watt Soundcore+ is plenty loud even when climbing up a 6% grade with 40,000 pounds cargo and the huge engine is screaming and the giant fan is blasting like a turboprop at takeoff. I mistakenly bought an Oontz unit with 24 watts and it does not connect easily nor provide adequate clarity or volume, the Anker Soundcore connects effortlessly. Easy automatic reconnect even after my audio book is interrupted by a phone call. I've left the speaker on all night while I sleep and there's plenty of juice left for NPR news with coffee at 4 AM without plugging in the USB. I really truly benefited from the ""table"" of products I found on Amazon for the Anker Soundcore speakers. With that I found the perfect unit for my truck. My old 12 watt unit lasted about 4 years blasting it's little heart out for me before it ruptured a diaphragm. I was so sad it blew up so when I found the table of Anker Soundcore speakers I grabbed-up my 30 watt unit because I trust the brand. I couldn't be happier with it. You might think that speech in an audio book would not need quality sound, but the high-res digital audio reproduces excellent clarity at any volume I need. Quality sound is important for audio books so you catch every nuance and inflection of the voice actor. I bought it specially for the truck and I just love it's audio quality, substantial physical weight and higher volume capacity, battery life is over the top, and I know it will withstand the high vibration and moisture environment and keep blasting away because it's little brother did. I will probably replace my big screen TV at home just so I can get a mega-blaster that rattles the deck plates from Soundcore !","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2022",AGHVEHQZT44AEEQ4PVHQV6LYOY3Q,True,0,Color: Black
R3HKYV5DWFVH6P,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible value!,da_musicman,5,"I own an original Bose Soundlink, a Bose Soundlink Mini 2 Special Edition and the Soundcore Motion+. The Motion+ is far and away the best value of the three. It’s midrange beat the pants off both Bose speakers. Without side by side comparison, I think most people would be happy with a any of these speakers but when compared side to side, my preference is definitely for the Motion+. It's the only one with a remote that has a graphic equalizer. That’s huge! The ability to fine tune the sound to your individual hearing gives it a gigantic edge. It sounds clean and full with decent bass (not overly exaggerated) and excellent midrange and highs. It has good build quality and is also waterproof. It can also be paired to a second Motion+ for a wider stereo soundstage. (The new Bose models also have this capability. There is a microphone for using it as a Bluetooth speaker phone if that floats your boat. It has a battery life rated at 12 hours though I haven’t had it long enough to deplete the initial charge. The Soundlink Mini 2 has a similar battery rating and I have to say is an engineering marvel. Though not perfect, the sounds that comes out of that tiny thing is nothing less than amazing. I think the original Bose Soundlink has the best soundstage of the three, followed by the Mini. The soundstage on the Motion+ is decent but not quite as good as its competitors. However, I think the overall sound quality of the Motion+ across the frequency spectrum is definitely the best. Highs (electric guitar) on the Mini can be somewhat strident and sounds much more smooth and natural on the Soundcore Motion+. The Soundcore just seems to have a much fuller sound with nothing or very little missing. (Keep in mind that these are all small portable Bluetooth speakers not high end studio monitors driven by great amplifiers so they all have limitations!) When switching to the Soundlink Mini 2, it sounds like something is missing. Oh, did I mention that the price of the Soundcore is only 100 bucks?! The Soundlink Mini 2 Special Edition is $150 at Costco. That’s 50% more and doesn’t sound as good to me. The original Soundlink sold for $300 if my memory serves me correctly. If size is a driving factor, then the Bose Mini 2 is worth exploring. However, if you can put up with a little larger but still relatively small speaker, in my opinion you will not find a better sounding speaker than the Soundcore Motion+ in the $100-$200 price range. It’s a solid buy. Anker did a great job with this speaker.","Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2021",AG7CABQBZF37LILPWYLUJ2OA5OEQ,True,1,Color: Black
RRGX14M3T4XYQ,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive sound, Bluetooth is weird",Aaron Reitz,5,"I got this to make computer audio audible when playing videos outside with my small group. For the price, the sound is pretty impressive, with decent bass and no obvious peaks. I think the output is mono, even though the speaker contains two drivers -- not a big deal on a small speaker meant to be listened to from a distance. It feels very solid and heavy in the hand and the body has a soft-touch coating on the plastic, giving a nice feel. (Note, though, that I've seen these coatings degrade into a gooey mess on other products, though I haven't had any issues so far on the Motion+.)My main gripe is with the way the speaker handles audio connectivity.First, when using it with a computer, I generally want to use the wired connection for audio rather than Bluetooth. However, the Motion+ defaults to trying to connect via Bluetooth every time you start it up, and sometimes it is difficult to figure out how to make it fall back to the wired connection. There is something flakey about its detection that the audio cable is plugged in.Second, I don't know if this is a problem with the Motion+ or with Bluetooth in general, but I've seen some weird behavior when multiple devices have been configured to connect with the speaker. Sometimes I'd have it connected with a computer one foot away by Bluetooth when suddenly the audio would cut out and I'd start hearing some other audio playing. It turns out that the speaker was switching to playing from my mother-in-law's iPad, that must have been 20-30 feet away at the time. It is maddening to me that another device could just cut in on an existing Bluetooth connection like this. It seems like a major security flaw. Strangely, I've also seen my phone try to play audio to the speaker even when I am miles away at the time, as if the phone can't tell that the speaker isn't present. Due to these issues, sometimes I have to just tell my devices to forget the speaker. It's really frustrating.Still, I don't run into these issues often enough to make the speaker unusable, and maybe I need to apply a firmware update or something. I'd still recommend the product for it's high-quality audio for the price.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2022",AGW5PEVKSAHGE34IPTUWCPWNDZJQ,True,2,Color: Black
R2ODBY2ZJQ8B9T,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible sounding speaker,Dave,5,"I bought this speaker primarily to use outdoors on my deck and patio areas. I researched reviews for bluetooth speakers under $100 from several reliable audio and tech websites; then watched YouTube demos. I narrowed my choices to Anker, Tribit, JBL and Oontz. I chose the Anker Soundcore Motion + for it's driver configuration (full range drivers with separate tweeters, passive radiator and bass port), 30-watt power and size. The ability to customize the sound with the Soundcore app was also a deciding factor.When I received the speaker, I was pleased with the build quality. Initial set-up was a snap, took less than a minute. I downloaded the Soundcore app and reviewed it's features and available options.Now, for the audition. Let me preface by saying, I am a guitar player. I listen to real music, played by real musicians, playing real instruments. I do NOT listen to computer-generated, sampled, auto-tuned disposable crap (no offense to those that do; everyone should listen to what they dig). I began with Fleetwood Mac's self-titled album from 1975 in ultra-HD on Amazon music. It's impeccably produced and has a great drum mix (a true test for any speaker) I scrolled through the pre-sets on the Soundcore app for the first track and dialed in my custom EQ on the available equalizer. I turned up the volume and stood back about 12 feet from the speaker. My jaw dropped. I could not believe the sound coming from this portable little speaker. Great full-range audio from lows to highs. Mick's drum were punchy and deep. Much better bass response than I anticipated (though I did need to dial it in with the EQ). Wonderful separation of instruments, crystal-clear vocals. The soundstage was surprisingly wide with good depth for a single speaker configuration (non stereo setup). I was impressed (and I am not easily). I mainly listen to vinyl or CD on vintage, audiophile quality equipment (I also stream in ultra HD with a quality DAC). The Soundcore Motion + far exceeded my expectations.Are there bluetooth speakers out there that are better, or louder or have more bass? Yes, of course. But not for $80. You will not be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2022",AGC3R2DUZQRWRCKO2HHQHR5HFLKQ,True,6,Color: Black

R1OF459KAAYVO8,B07P39MLKH,3.0 out of 5 stars Awesome speaker; appallingly short Bluetooth range.,No,3,"I’ve had this speaker for a little over a year now. In almost all respects, I have been very impressed. Unfortunately, the Bluetooth range (or lack thereof) is a serious flaw.The good:The sound quality is amazing for such a small speaker. I never would have expected such a rich bass from a speaker this size.The Soundcore app allows me to customize the EQ for my tastes. This allows me get the most out of the small speaker without washing out the overall sound with pure volume.Charging, portability, and durability are all right where they should be. Again, very impressed by the quality.The bad:The Bluetooth range is appallingly limited. I have connected the speaker to multiple iPhones. Most of my Bluetooth devices can maintain a solid connection well over 20 yards, especially if the devices are within line-of-sight. This speaker, however, will start to drop a Bluetooth connection in less than 5 yards, even without obstacles in the way.It is a serious flaw. There is no point in having a Bluetooth connection if the phone needs to be that close to the speaker. I might as well buy a 3.5mm cable and just hardwire the connection.If you want to use the speaker during a backyard cookout, that’s fine. But you’ll have to leave your phone sitting right next to the speaker instead of in your pocket as you walk around.Again, it’s a great speaker, but the short Bluetooth range is a serious flaw.____UPDATE after another 6 months:*When connected to the charger, it may not be able to draw enough power to function at higher volumes. I used it at a party recently, and I had to keep the volume at maximum (or close to it). The battery died after about 3 hours; no surprise there. I hooked up the charging cable and turned it back on. Every 10 to 15 minutes it would die again. I'm assuming that, at full volume, it uses more power than it can draw through the charging cable. This is very disappointing. This is the only time I have used it on max volume for extended times and the only time I have used it hardwired to the charger. But it should be able to draw power consistently enough to function.For what it's worth, even at the high volumes the sound quality was still impressive. The bass was a little lacking, but it's still impressive.*The bluetooth range is still appalling. It's also inconsistent. I actually got it to connect at around 20 yards the other day. But it would randomly crackle out or drop the connection. Again, I eventually just placed my phone right next to the speaker.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2023",AFYI4JVG2NYFLOBVED2TLERIPIAA,True,6,Color: Black
RGV7Y77KCH4HF,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Physics cannot be cheated; the hype is unfounded,Frank Doghearty,4,"(08/10/2020) After several months of satisfactory performance, I am raising my rating from 3 to 4.(Original review:) In order to be fair, I used the wired connection for this review. (The speakerphone feature works well, which alone is making this a keeper for me.)The tiny drivers simply cannot produce anything close to a pair of 30-year-old Sony amplified speakers with 3"" drivers. In fact, the sound resembles the tiny USB speakers that came out 15-20 years ago, possibly because that's where its sound comes from: tiny speakers. Of course, for the price, you do get some privileges: namely, bass-reflex design and silk domes, both of which far surpassing the potentials of cheap, tiny computer speakers.Some reviewers did note that using the app would give away ""your voice"" for free, so that is obviously not an option for those who care for that sort of thing. Without the utility that enables various equalizer settings (out of which the basic setting should have been built in to begin with), the device falls flat, exhibiting all the shortcomings that its tiny drivers entail (the uncompressed sound coming from an iPad 3, using music and movies from Amazon Prime). Severely colored sound, bad to the point that even mp3 sound just as ""good"" (or shall I say, bad) as uncompressed sound. Some people compared the sound to a DOSS Soundbox SL, but the latter actually reflects the difference between mp3 and uncompressed sound to the point that mp3 comes through severely distorted, because that's just the way mp3 sounds like. Of course, that makes this unit a winner for listening to mp3. For the Soundbox SL, that's a punishment for producing untainted sound (of course, there are better speakers out there, but they also cost more; I got my SL for $56 at the manufacturer's site and got $30 off this one, which I still find a bit much for the actual performance, although I am sure that two of these would be much better than a single unit and these can be paired for stereo sound, as opposed to the current Soundbox SL).NOTICE that my DOS Soundbox stopped working properly after about 10 uses, but is out of warranty, and this one is working fine!The bells and whistles, silk domes for the treble and a passive membrane for the ""bass"" do contribute, although only the treble is fairly improved, because such tiny drivers simply cannot defeat physics. Realistically speaking, ""bass"" starts over 100Hz, and any tweaking simply upsets the sound image and the sound balance.The price is paid for1. Outstanding battery life2. Being somewhat waterproof (I would not venture to experiment with that, but splashproofness seems reasonably true)3. Sophisticated design with extra ""bass"" (that is not really bass)4. Silk domes5. The option to pair two of these for stereo sound6. Excellent BT performance7. There is some stereo imaging, if you are using this below a matchingly small screen.However, if you are looking for a steady sound image without loudness and detailed, dynamic sound, look elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2019",AHXUNV656OFRHCTBGKYFCYS6UEHQ,True,13,Color: Black

After thousands of hours of speaker reviews, I settled on this one.So far I'm not regretting the extra 20 watts I could have had from a Dockin D Fine + 2 as this gets pretty loud. In fact, I never felt the need to have this above 40% volume and this just sounds great.It was annoying at first since it randomly increased the volume during audio playback & when changing or restarting tracks but after unpairing from my devices and resetting the speaker, it seems to have solved the issue.I would have preferred physical buttons for previous and next track instead of the useless ""Bass up"" button since the feature can be enabled in the app. You'd need the app for firmware updates and sound customization and other settings, like auto off when not in use which you can set to your preferred time.The power button is a bit stiff and it's an arm workout to turn on this speaker. It also just dies abruptly without any sound notification when using the aux cable (not sure if its thw same with Bluetooth) and takes over 4 hours to fully recharge.You'd want to enable ""Bass up"" or Custom but with a flat profile because it sounds exactly like Bass up.

Seems to do well enough across the gamut but I like it best for lower volume bass heavy instrumental music that I listen to while doing other tasks.I've tried to use other bluetooth speakers I have that have aux ports for my PC (bose home speaker 300 in particular). In comparison: - This sounds as good or better to me, bose has a special warmth to it that this lacks but this seems more accurate and punches with just as much bass for a small speaker array. - This is portable/has a battery that the bose doesn't - The bose thinks I'm talking to alexa all the time and does weird things that this doesn't - The bose requires me to turn it back to ""Aux"" mode every time i sit down at my computer, not sure why - The bose doesn't have a mcirophone in it, this does and seems to work wellMinor complaints for my use case: - Super short cords USB-C and aux cords - going to have to fix that - The port cover on the side is a little annoying to have to leave open to get to the power/aux ports - It doesn't do bluetooth and aux sound at the same time while playing from your phone. This is more minor annoyance because some apps play silent sound constantly when they are in the foreground which mutes computer sound even though nothing is playing. More an issue with ios/those apps, but it's annoying when you get on a conference call and can't figure out why you can't hear people. You can have a phone connected that's not playing any sound and play the computer audio without issue though.

I think it was maybe my friend David.Anyway, without opening his mouth, he spoke deep into my soul. A rumbling, almost tectonic voice:""DO YOU FEEL COMPLETE?""I could not speak, only a slight shake of my head once I understood that my answer was no.""DO YOU FEEL THE VOID, THE MISSING PIECE OF THE PUZZLE?""I nodded, more assertively this time, without hesitation.""I CAN SHOW YOU THE WAY TO ENLIGHTENMENT, IF YOU ARE READY.""This time I spoke.

Everything is game, and this speaker handles it all impressively. From Coltrane to the Stones, and everything between.Out of the box, the frequency response is flat. That is by design, to give you a reference point for shaping the sound the way you want. To appreciate the capabilities of this speaker you MUST download the Soundcore app, where you can adjust the EQ to whatever suits you. There are several presets in the app, but the real difference-maker is in the ""custom"" setting, which gives you 9 bands of EQ to fiddle with. If I had to describe this speaker's performance in one word, that word would be ""balanced"". If you're into bass-dominant listening (rap/hip-hop), you'll probably be better served by one of the boom-box models.

I waited a few weeks before leaving a review to be sure, but I love it. The sound quality is excellent, as many others have stated this thing gets LOUD. Use the custom EQ for the best sound (I'm a rap fan so as a bass heavy genre it handles it perfectly!) Noticed minor clipping on certain songs (""Top Back"" by T.I. for anyone who knows it as an example) just go down one notch from max and it's good. Definitely plan on buying a second to link together and my ONLY gripe is that it won't accept more lol. It CAN play while charging if not charging from a fully dead battery, it will cut off until it reaches a certain level. Haven't played it constantly so I can't speak to the total battery life just yet, however, I've used it intermittently for a couple hours for an entire week and it lasted with no problems so I imagine a full day at the beach would be fine. The update solved the issues in the comments on the EQ saving and mine saved right out the box. Outside of that, it's done everything I needed and more, can't wait until we can get back out and I can use it for it's intended purpose! Stop reading reviews. I read over 400 on various competing products and watched hours of YouTube videos so I got you on the research lol this is the one.Update: 12/21/21: I've owned this speaker for about 2 years now so I have a full understanding of it's quirks and features and everything in between.

I have since bought another and saw someone else mention they are running more than 2 so please share how because I would have one in every room of the house if I could. These have been everywhere. Thrown in the back of the truck on beach day and plays LOUD the entire day. When we hit the beach it's from 10-5 and they last the entire time.

Calvert,5,"I've had a lot of Bluetooth speakers: Sony, JBL, Creative, Logitech, UE, Bose.....but I have to say I have become a true soundcore fan. Besides this speaker, I also have the Motion Boom and the Motion Boom Plus. They all sound phenomenal. In my opinion, Soundcore gives you the most bang for your buck. The Motion + has become one of my favorite speakers, so much so that I just ordered this one so I could hook them up in stereo. Unfortunately when I got this speaker I couldn't get them to connect even though I followed the instructions. I was informed by Soundcore that this was because my previous model had an older chip and firmware and they were not compatible. I was prepared to send this one back but the Soundcore rep went above and beyond to help by letting me trade my older version for a new one. WOW! Great customer service. I am certainly a Soundcore fan for life now. I'm a retired audiophile. I've had a lot of expensive stereo equipment in the past with outboard dacs and the whole nine yards. You're not gonna get audiophile quality in a Bluetooth speaker, especially one for a $100 or less. However, what you will get in this speaker is a lot of quality sound for the price. It's definitely worthy of the near 5 star rating. It's a very well rounded speaker with excellent highs, good mids and more than adequate bass. The app is user friendly and helpful in tailoring the sound to your liking. You can add another for stereo and the customer service is, what can I say, excellent.

RLNPR7VGAQIP3,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars WHOA! Yes, it's all that!",G. Curran,5,"I have an older Altec Lansing BT speaker. It's small, I've had it for a few years, it works pretty well for what it is. I probably paid $60 for it when I got it.I wanted something better, with more bass, better sounds. I don't need multiple speaker set up, or anything like that. I'm a musician, well, keyboard player, and my standard of reference is a pair of KRK Rokit RP-5s. They are very nice, low end monitoring speakers and I drive them from a high end D/A converter. The sound, for me, at 64 years of age, is all that I need.The Soundcore Motion + blew me away with it's sound. I would say that it rivals the RP-5s in clarity and sound discrimination. I did a lot of 'research' on new BT speaker, meaning I watches some YouTube videos, and the Soundcore Motion + always seemed to come out near the top of the pack. I can see why.If you want clear, crisp highs, a wonderful midrange and bass that is clear and accurate (I'm not talking window rattling bass, but bass that sounds like acoustic bass should), then this really is the speaker for you.The free downloadable app for your phone gives you custom EQ capabilities, plus there's an aux in for laptops and such that may not use BT.I am truly impressed by this. I'm also further impressed that by an additional $10 shipping cost, I ordered at 11 a.m. and had the unit here at 6 p.m. The only thing that would have made it any better was if it had gotten here 30 minutes sooner, since I was going out to a party, and it would have worked wonders there.So, if you're on the fence about this speaker, spend the $105 for it. I haven't listened to the Bose or the Sony or the JBL speakers, all of which are probably good speakers, but in the $100 range, I don't think you're going to do too much better than this speaker!

R152BTEUFK4UBY,B07P39MLKH,5.0 out of 5 stars *****************PLEASE READ UPDATED REVIEW*******************,BBB,5,"Read the reviews so I took the plunge. I wanted to like it a lot but the sound quality left too much to be desire for my taste. Even with the app, which allows you to make various adjustments, I could never really fine-tune to my liking. We sent it back and purchased our second Beats Pill +. To each his own.-----------------------------------------------------UPDATE BELOW-------------------------------------------------First The Good: Anker Soundcore Motion+ Bluetooth Speaker delivers excellent sound for the money on a variety of music genres. But I will say that in my specific case I did need to use the EQ, available as an app download, to get my sound to a level that would make this beautiful looking speaker shine. Now about that app,-Once the Anker Soundcore Motion+ Bluetooth Speaker is charged you will want to set up the previously mentioned custom EQ. To do that you’ll have to download the app. To use the Ankers Soundcore App, it does seem to want a lot of feedback which I’m sure is for future product enhancements. The decision is yours to use it or not. I had no problem.The longer we have used the speaker the more we enjoy the fun that comes with it. From its portable design, sturdy and solid craftsmanship, it’s built to last. One thing I enjoy is the power button glows white while powered and changes to a blinking red when the battery is low. In this mode, it automatically plays at a reduced volume until plugged in. Once plugged into a charger via the USB-C port, Anker Soundcore Motion+ Bluetooth Speaker increases in volume and continues to play while charging. Nice touch!I was able to get all of my eclectic music to sound very fine-tuned. I especially loved how I could Bluetooth to my TV and have my own personal speaker as to not disturb the neighbors on those late nights.My one issue is that at higher volumes it did tend to distort and I could not find a fix but with many EQ settings at my disposal we were able to come to a happy experience and satisfied with the sound.This is a solid speaker with the potential to sit alongside the BEATS PILL+(which I own) UE BOOMBOX(which I own)and in my opinion, is much better than the Bose SoundLink Mini II Bluetooth Speaker. (which I own)Lastly, the speaker gets 4 stars for quality and price but because Anker is invested in providing outstanding products and customer service then my all-around score is a solid 5.Great Fathers Day gift people.

R2SC66DMOUNCBC,B07P39MLKH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Anker customer support reached out, perfectly resolved!",Matthew,5,"Rewrite from an earlier review as Anker has reached out to me. But they did NOT ask me to edit or change my review. This is all my own doing (just a heads up).Initially, I had purchased this product due to all the stellar reviews from various audio reviewers. Item arrives and there is a terrible static, almost like a grounding wire was knocked loose, I'm not sure. Imagine turning on a CRT tv in the middle of the night at full volume with no signal. I had used the motion+ in a different system, different set-up, even had some friends of mine try a hand at it just to make sure it wasnt me.But it happens, there's bound to be a dud every so often. I returned the unit for a replacement. And that replacement, same exact thing. Same steps to troubleshoot but at that point, I was done with the product. I do have more anker products than I can count, they make some great hardware, but the motion+ in particular I figured I was done with. Let other people enjoy it, not worth the headache.I left an earlier review expressing as much and sure enough, a customer rep from Anker actually reached out to me. I like most people have grown very cynical when it comes to dealing with companies standing by their products and actually honoring their warranties BUT the entire experience has more than made up for the earlier issues. I'm still waiting on the replacement to arrive but until then, 5/5 at least for the customer service experience, and that's saying a lot these days.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2023",AHHH34PFU33JE5K5W5SPHHUD5IWA,True,2,Color: Black

Sometimes, I just don't want to have to wear earbuds.The Soundcore Motion+ did not disappoint. It's a solid performer, has punchy bass, and you can tune the EQ to your heart's content via the app. The speaker has heft, thanks to the 12-hour battery life. It feels like a quality product. It also has USB-C charging, which is a must in 2023.If I were to nit about anything, if you hold the speaker up to your ear, you can hear a distinct hiss when nothing's playing. However, practically speaking, this doesn't bother me since, at listening distance (arm's length or longer), you can't hear the hiss at all.If they go on sale again, I might buy another to pair it up.","Reviewed in the United States December 25, 2023",AGZFQCCRUPOIOUPZ2DRK6Z5WBOJA,True,5,Color: Black
R250K91U05W3UX,B07P39MLKH,3.0 out of 5 stars Great frequency response for size,Pat,3,"Update: Bluetooth on this speaker is the worst. It takes precedence over a connection. Also my husband keeps turning off the connection in the app and if he even touches his phone, even having turned off the connection, it automatically overrides my own Bluetooth connection while I'm in the middle of playing a song. He unpaired permanently and hopefully this will be fixed. But there's the problem of my laptop. I'll be sure to unpair that permanently too. Never pair this thing with more than one device. It blows, because I need to use it with my laptop and my phone for original music projects I'm working on. The app doesn't do anything to help. Bluetooth just needs to die. However, I've not run into this with my little JBL speaker. It will not allow anyone to connect to it when it's currently paired with something else.Of course, my stupid phone has no mini jack output so I can't give up on Bluetooth altogether.Previous reviewI got this as a portable speaker to bring to music composition lessons. I'm composing music on the computer (hobby only) and it was hard to hear the lowest frequency instruments (cello, contrabass so far) on my JBL clip speaker. This isn't as good as studio monitor speakers, but so much more portable. And there's an equalizer in the app.I work on music in a casual hobby band too, and this will be much easier for me to hear the instruments, particularly the bass, in tracks they send me.I usually use very large, high-quality speakers for music listening but don't consider myself an audiophile. This is a Bluetooth speaker that's intended to be a portable convenience and has enough bass that you can hear the bass line loud and clear. The sound overall is crisp and pleasing. If I want the best, I'm not going to get that from a speaker I can put in a tote bag. For about $100, this totable speaker is honestly amazing.","Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2023",AHQ4HD6B6SKRYX4ON5PYMWBSTLTQ,True,4,Color: Black

I think it is absolutely ridiculous that two speakers that are the same model cannot pair together even though that is an advertised feature. That is something that should be clearly stated as I now have to go through the hassle of returning it and wasted an hour of my life trying to get the speakers to pair.

R30CETOJIZVBRA,B07P39MLKH,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent speaker that could use some design updates,Nick Cunningham,4,"This is probably your best option at this price point in the ""large but still somewhat packable speaker"" market. The speaker is slightly larger than a 20 oz. soda bottle laid flat, but much heavier; you could pack this in a suitcase but it's probably going to take up too much room in a carry on or backpack unless you aren't bringing much else. It'll probably do fine in a bag to take to the beach or a cookout. It produces enough clear sound to fill large rooms easily and sounds good with the bass boost activated (and not great without it).I'm docking one star because in an effort to be sleek (and waterproof), Anker sacrificed some ease of use with the button layout. As you can see in the picture above, there are five buttons on the top of the speaker. In short, the buttons are confusing, mushy, and easily show wear.Two of the buttons you are likely using most often, the volume buttons, are the 2nd and 5th buttons in the layout. If you aren't looking directly at the speaker, it's very easy to accidentally hit the Bluetooth pairing button when attempting to turn the volume up, or to hit the center button when trying to turn the volume down. The center button is just the logo, which gives no indication to what it actually does (multifunction play/pause/skip), which is fine if you own the speaker but not great if you ask someone else to change songs. Finally, the buttons have that mushy, silicone feel that makes you wonder if you actually activated it, and despite attempting to clean them, they look very worn after only a few presses. I know that some of this was probably done to improve the waterproofing of the speaker. I have to wonder who the audience is supposed to be, then. Are people taking these into the ocean? Or into their swimming pools at home? Or dancing in the rain? It just doesn't feel like a common enough use case to warrant the trade off.These small-ish quibbles aside, I've enjoyed the speaker and I think it's still the best option at this price point. I just think if could be even better.","Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2021",AE5NTZ7O2YOXZWMEJINA5PB7YMBA,True,0,Color: Black

While not quite as good as the Sonos speakers, for the $$ these speakers nail the sound. Pairing 2 speakers in a stereo pair is very easy.The speakers have multiple sound presets and a 9-band EQ configurable via the mobile app. (NOTE: I also bought the Space Q45 NC headphones and used the HearID recommended 8-band EQ settings for configuring the Motion+ EQ.) I absolutely love the sound from the speakers with my custom EQ settings for Rock, Blues, and Metal.I can't speak to the battery life because I bought Anker USB power adapters and all 4 speakers are connected to power 100% of the time.The mobile app is serviceable, but short on extra features. For instance, the app only tracks one pair of the Motion+ speaker pairs at a time. The app has to disconnect from one set to connect to another. Also there is no L/R fader function in the app to adjust the balance between the paired speakers. I have submitted requests to Anker Soundcore support to add features to remember devices and customize the names, and to add the fader feature.Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase of the Motion+ speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2023",AF362OS3S3ZXUTFMGPOFXHLFFDGA,True,1,Color: Black

While watching almost anything, I cannot pick up any delay in the sound vs peoples lips on screen, a constant problem I've had with earlier Bluetooth devices. I've had identical experiences with my Android phone as well. However my devices are fairly up to date on the Bluetooth standards, and that is likely why they work so well. Experiences will vary if you have a device with older bluetooth equipment in them.I have had no problems with the app, and dialing in the sound for my music. The presets are ok, but really only ok. But after some minor tweaking, it really is as good as advertised. And it can get loud enough for me. When I crank it all the way up, I have to really try to be heard over it, so if you need it loud I think this does a very serviceable job.I haven't run it down to empty yet, but I've used it for numerous hours in a row without issue.

Since everyone's hearing is different, I really recommend using the Soundcore app on your phone and do Custom EQ settings that sound right to you. I didn't like any of the EQ Presets. So I have officially changed my mind and increased my rating from 3 to 4 Stars. I think this was worth the price and would definitely recommend this BT Speaker.Original From Feb. 2021:I'm a bit disappointed for the price considering it supposed to be 30W of power. Thought I would take the chance since it has separate left and right mid-range and tweeter drivers. There are so many positive reviews and youtube videos comparing this to the larger JBL Charge 4 and others. In my opinion this doesn't sound as good or pack the punch of the smaller JBL Flip 4 or 5. I put the Soundcore app on my phone, tried the BassUp and all EQ Presets. It sounded better with my own Custom EQ settings.It sounds pretty good up to half volume. Going above that and there is distortion in the mid-range and treble, and gets worse the higher it goes. The max volume is tied to my Bluetooth device, and once the max is reached on the device then pressing the volume up on the speaker has no effect. On other BT speakers like JBL & Sony I can increase the volume more on the speakers after the BT sources is at max volume.Listening to quality music is very important to me and 98% of my music library is full CD quality FLAC files. Either I got a defective unit or Anker is putting out a lot of dishonest review and videos. I'm thinking about returning this and going with the JBL Flip 5 even though it has only 1 active Transducer driver. Anker had a good idea here for a compact BT speaker, but it doesn't live up to all the hype.","Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2021",AEOUB25MPZ4HGZQTKKUXWTPU5JLQ,True,0,Color: Black

I like that one can see the speakers through the grill, while feeling confident that said speakers are well protected, since themesh is metal not fabric. This will make wiping it down easier, too. I hate fabric speaker covers, they're dust magnets and a pain to clean.The sound: Remarkable! Especially for such a small sized unit. Honestly, it looks bigger in the photos, and it's the perfect size for any shelf or table. The sound is so crisp and clear, yet you can honestly feel the bass, and that's not even with the Bass boost enabled. The Soundcore app is easy to use and gives you access to an EQ mixer, as well as a range of presets. I use the EQ mixer, and you can clearly hear the difference as you adjust. It's also clearly well made. The unit feels hella solid and it's surprisingly heavy, which is a good thing! You're not likely to find great quality sound and quality construction in a plastic, lightweight speaker. This bad boy has a metal body and feels solid AF.My only knock would be that the control buttons on top of the unit are unlit, and the same color (black) as the rest of the unit, making it difficult to see which button is which. But this is really pretty minor, given that most of us will use the soundcore app or our music app, to adjust the controls instead of manually with the hard to read buttons. Also, once you learn which does what, it's a non-issue.I highly recommend this speaker for anyone who wants a high quality portable speaker with excellent sound-for-size/price.

But it’s about the same, maybe even a little worse. The speaker sounds pretty flat out of the box and you need to use the Soundcore app on your phone to EQ it for a richer, wider sound. This EQ doesn’t stay when you disconnect from your phone and use a computer (there’s no soundcore app for windows.) overall the default sound is acceptable but I’m sure there’s speakers out there that sound better for $100 (I got the speaker for about $80 with a sale.)The speaker is also way bigger and heavier than the Boost. The boost is pretty easy to pack in a camping bag or backpack but the Motion is a bit unwieldy and awkward.The upside for this is that the battery should be much better and it is notably louder, but those two perks are irrelevant for my use case and the Boost was loud enough with a good enough battery.If you’re considering this speaker, I’d go for the Soundcore Boost instead.","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2023",AGDCVTOYPW4DSRPI3477OGIPO2QA,True,2,Color: Black

It doesn't have any bass to speak of, but it does have richly textured lower midtones (which I'd say are more important), and sparkling treble notes. My wife also loves it. If I was hosting barbecues, and inviting company over, it would not be nearly big enough. For parties I'd get the larger model B&O portable. But I just put this little thing on the patio table with the wine and snacks, and its perfect for myself and my wife. Battery life seems to be very good.

R2N9LGOT33J14T,B08YRT9T38,4.0 out of 5 stars A Posh Music speaker!,RT - Gadget Guy,4,"B&O makes posh high end audio gear….gear which showcases the most avant-garde design which would be at home in any modern art museum (MOMA indeed has some of the past B&O iconic products in their exhibits). Normally their gear is priced out of the range of normal-average-hard-working folk ($10000 speakers for example), but with this product, you can get to experience a slice of the life of the upper 0.1%!In all seriousness, this is a regular tiny Bluetooth speaker which has a price at least 5X more than your average tiny Bluetooth speaker. So what do you get for that premium? First, the whole shell is made of metal. It feels cool to the touch. It has hard “Type II anodization” on the aluminum shell which will help resist scratches, and should take the hard knocks while it’s hanging off your backpack using the supplied carabiner clip. The speaker is IPX67 meaning it’s water and dust resistant. You can immerse the whole thing into water for a very short period even.Soundwise, this is a tiny speaker so don’t expect much in terms of volume and thump. It will start to distort if you try to turn it up too high (it's not going to fill a large room in your house). It sounds smooth and the tonality is slightly warm (you hear less of the treble and more of the midrange). Deep bass is nonexistent, but there’s just enough of upper bass tones that you can follow the rhythm of the beat. Measurements on other review sites show that it doesn’t reproduce any content below 100Hz. Basically, it doesn’t reinvent any laws of acoustics and still sounds like a small speaker. But the overall sound quality is clean and the tonality is pleasant. it’s a portable speaker that you can carry with you anywhere, so you can have some music while boating, at the beach, hiking, camping etc. It just works!Battery life is good, at lower and moderate volumes, it easily lasts 10+ hours. Controls are simple: power, volume, play/pause/skip forward backwards. It isn’t necessary to install the app but the app is useful because it gives you the exact battery percentage, turn-off the auto-standby feature if you don’t want it, and has some presets to select a different sound signature or alternatively you can fine tune the strength of the treble/midrange/bass precisely by moving around a slider into four quadrants on the screen. I think it sounds fine with the default “optimized” preset. Also as a bonus, you can plug this into your computer with the USB and used it like a wired USB speaker. You can pair two Bluetooth devices to it, which is the norm nowadays.So is it worth it? By the way, I bought this at a 45% discount (check amazon price history for this product) and even though it’s still not inexpensive, I feel it is good value. Even if it had cost more, I would not have been disappointed. I don’t mind paying more for something that feels like it’s going to last, and with B&O, you get some cutting edge design with great sound engineering.This is a 5 star product, but minus 1 star just because I would have liked to have a microphone so that it acts as speakerphone. Also, because of the bluetooth profile, your device won't show the battery percentage on the phone itself, you have to view the percentage in the app. And the sound is good but it doesn't manage to break any laws of physics (not blaming the speaker but I had hoped that it would really stand out among other small speakers of this size with the bag of tricks that B&O geniuses have up their sleeves. The result is merely very good rather than exceptional). So result is 4 out of 5","Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024",AE6TVTGGPRUEMJMSIV5SX6NDA2PA,True,7,Color: NavyStyle: Bluetooth speaker

The IOS/Android app is very weak but once it's set up you don't need to use it again. Note, this is not a party speaker.

RMFEKPJTVWHES,B08YRT9T38,3.0 out of 5 stars It’s good but I’m a little disappointed,Garden nymph,3,"I have had many wireless speakers. UE boom, UE roll (both good for the money). I have a Harmon kardon gen 1 or 2 Bluetooth that sounds excellent. I have an Audi A 5 convertible with a B and O sound system that is just the best thing ever. I had never heard B and O until I got the Audi. So. Now I have refurbished a vintage travel trailer and wanted some killer sound while I’m camping. It’s a small space so I don’t need anything like the Harmon Kardon. Plus that needs an outlet. So I’m thinking what does B and O offer in a small package? I got this speaker for $118 because of the gray color I guess. It was cheaper than black. I downloaded the app. And with some adjustments to the bass /treble on the app I was able to get a satisfactory sound. Was I blown away. Sadly not. I was expecting a lot more from B and O. Even if it’s just a wireless speaker. It’s not bad by any means. And I guess for the price it’s a good value. I guess I’m comparing it to my Audi stereo system which is just amazing. 🤩 I can crank it to infinity and it’s crystal clear. I like crisp sound that I can distinctly hear all the beautiful components. Is that too much to ask for in a wireless Bluetooth speaker from the infamous B and O? Like l said it’s not bad any means. But I guess my expectations were too high. It can be cranked to a point. But I’d like it louder. Anyway. Just my rambling thoughts. I’m in my little camper now drinking some beer on a sunny Saturday afternoon listening to some jazz and just chillin.

RDUDX86L13ELO,B08YRT9T38,5.0 out of 5 stars I really like it!,Rod,5,"I’ve seen too many bad reviews on this one so I wanted to give my opinion. First bear in mind that not all speakers are for everyone. Speakers are like clothes, perfumes, etc. You choose them according to your tastes but in order to buy the right one (speakers) first you you need to ask yourself a couple of questions. What kind of music do I listen to? What kind of brand do I relate with? What am I expecting of it? This portable speaker doesn’t really have deep bass, TRUE, but it is there. Apart from that, the voicing of it is great. The vocals sound clear and warm and its ability of playing a song with lots of sounds and instruments is great for such a small portable speaker.I own many portable speakers including the Bose revolve+ and I prefer the Explore in most of the cases. Again, if you want a speaker for extreme bass music, this is not the one, but if you like Vocal music, smooth Jazz like Diana Krall you are going to love it.If you want a party speaker this is not the one either, but if you want a speaker that accompanies you during your walks or have it with you in your office or home without stealing all your attention this is the one for you because although this little speaker can get loud it does it with class and without being obnoxious.

The ability to hang it with a carabiner was an incredibly important consideration for me. It’s a beautiful piece of engineering.Performance is exceptional when used with the app which allows fine tuning. It’s incredibly loud, fills a space and has rich audio. Do not care about bass as you won’t get meaningful bass out of a small speaker for the most part. Clear audio is the name of the game and this speaker breaks so many rules.

As an avid audiophile with a penchant for high-end audio equipment, I was excited to add this to my collection. The build quality is exceptional, a true testament to the craftsmanship that went into its design. However, when it comes to the volume, I can't help but feel a sense of disappointment. The sound it produces, while undoubtedly of high quality, is a bit subdued for my taste. As someone who values the intricacies and nuances of audio, I expected more power and presence. While I appreciate the materials and construction, the volume, and the bass issue leaves me wanting more. While I understand the need for portability, the subdued volume simply doesn't cut it for me. Music should have the power to fill a space, to move people, and to evoke emotions, and this speaker falls short in that department. It's crucial for me to have a device that can truly capture the essence of my music, and unfortunately, this one falls short in that regard for those reasons I have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2023",AFUJHHCQZAAFBM6YYCAIOHJOIIBA,True,10,Color: Black AnthraciteStyle: Bluetooth speaker

R2OOWD9I530XTQ,B08YRT9T38,4.0 out of 5 stars Absolute gem.......but a disappointing low amount of bass,Tim,4,"Let me start off by saying I did a LOT for research on smaller Bluetooth speakers before making a purchase – which includes reading review/articles and listening to YouTube reviews. I currently have a 3rd generation Oontz Angle 3 Ultra that’s I’ve had for 6 years and was in need of replacing – not because it was worn out, but I just wanted something newer and nicer but generally the same size with more power/more clarity. The B&O explore caught my attention right away due to the design and name. The price seemed a bit eye-watering, but I was really attracted to the battery life (a must for me), the design (very modern and durable), and the fact that is wasn’t a ‘smart speak’. I purchased the speaker, and downloaded the B&O app. The app is a MUST if you want ANY bass projection at all. Everything about this speaker is perfect for me…..except for the bass. There just isn’t any bass! Even with the app settings set to product as much bass as possible, the Explore just can’t deliver. Ultimately, this is a disappointment, as the price tag just doesn’t justify the sounds quality. All B&O need to do is add a little more bass for a perfect – if expensive – speaker! A it stands the JBL Flip 6 is the perfect speaker in this category and is only about $100 – so half the price of the B&O Explore. Here hoping B&O will make a Explore 2.0 with more bass, but will retain everything else that makes this speaker so cool.","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2023",AHQTQTOQV5PGD55DUMHONIDGOHCQ,True,19,Color: NavyStyle: Bluetooth speaker

Unfortunately, because I thought this would be a great product because this a well respected brand, I threw out the box it came in, otherwise I would have returned it. There is absolutely no bass, it's not that loud, the app is glitchy and won't change the equalizer. If you want to spend the a little less money and get a really good product, get a Harmon / Kardon Luna for $100 less. Or a Soundcore Motion X600 for $50 less. Those things sound a million times better. One that surprised me was the UE Wonder Boom 4 for only $100, and it's a similar size with twice the max volume and way better sound. Severely disappointed.

The price for this speaker I feel is worth every penny. The speaker does have weight to it. Not too heavy but because it is made out of quality metal it adds weight compared to cheap plastic ones. However that weight provides better sound since there is no rattling like plastic speakers. It’s a great size and looks amazing wherever you put it. It performs great in small rooms but in large rooms if you put it towards the center of the room it really fills the room. The sound is incredible for something so small. The quality of the sound doesn’t change as you turn it even all the way up. I was really impressed at what a clean sound it has. I do move it from room to room and bought it primarily for around the house but have also used it outside and taken it with me. Because it’s metal and looks so good and I want to keep it that way when putting it in a bag I put it in a small case type bag. However I haven’t been overly careful sign it around the house and even dropped it and nothing happened to it. The strap is well made also and really convenient and looks good because it’s well made as well.

I used to have a wonderboom and was happy with it until it finally croaked. I wanted something with long battery life, that was waterproof and decently rugged, and that had good sound quality. I initially bought another wonderboom but hated it! I did tons of research because I needed to replace it with something. I bring my little speaker everywhere and use it all the time. I’m so glad I gave this a shot. It’s perfect for my needs. I expected good sound quality, but I think that the sound quality on the Beosound Explore is *great* when you consider where it’s coming from. Everything is super balanced, and the app is useful if you want to do a bit of “fine tuning” to the EQ. It charges via USB-C. And I love that it comes with a little strap and carabiner. I use that all the time, actually, and it’s super convenient. The design and craftsmanship on the whole is stunning, and something I really appreciate. I feel like the machined aluminum casing probably lends to the sound quality this little thing can produce, but I’m not a sound engineer so this is just speculation. I got this for a steal of a deal on prime day - I think I paid like $130. For that price, I don’t think there’s anything better. If this speaker had a microphone, I think that would take it to the next level and make it worthy of some extra cash, but it’s not something I really need. My only two gripes are the design of the top - it collects water since there is a lip around the edge. The other is that it did sound a little “tinny” once when I probably turned the volume up way too much on one particular song - by way too much, I mean all the way up, like 100%. So unless you frequently do that, you’ll probably never experience it.Update 1 year and 2 months later - the speaker has started failing. It is distorting whatever audio I try to play. I have not done anything crazy with this - it’s never been dropped or exposed to any really extreme environments.

But lack of basic functions make it a waste of money, especially as it wastes so much time. It usually powers on at full volume, no matter how volume is adjusted on the device it’s connected to.And adjusting volume from your device is randomly not an option. also you need to download an app to use it at all. If more than one device has it saved, you don’t get to decide which device the speaker will connect to. Mid-play, the speaker will switch to the other device, then in order to switch back, you’d have to forget the speaker on one device or turn off Bluetooth. It takes a very particular situation for uninterrupted and dramatic comedy-free playback. I already spent way too much money and time to switch out so I am now on a journey of learning to let this thing helo me laugh at myself LOL.","Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2024",AGDYCI2PZ6BZV5TQ42VAJKN3O6UQ,True,3,Color: ChestnutStyle: Bluetooth speaker

I mainly listen to classical music and popular music.I pick Explore because it has the ability to present the music I love in a very good and pleasant way.Sound quality:Bose’s sound is nice, but it is too emphasized on bass that the music became incorrect. Sonos’ Roam is a close runner-up, but it’s sound is too soft in the bass and too puncture in the middle. Emberton is great for the popular music but for classical music, some wind instruments sound a bit wrong. The A1 from B&Q is surprisingly a bit spread out that the focus went too far. Explore is a small speaker that has the fault of closed up sound that every small speaker has, but it shows the ability to produce a pleasant balance that I love.Functions:The last thing I want is they recording my shower singing in those Alexa/Siri enable smart speaker, so this speaker is best for privacy concerns.I recommend you download the app and play around to find the sound you like! For me it’s a tad between warm and energetic shown in the picture.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2021",AEL6F4HSUCDRWGUO44A2VKNRDE2A,True,54,Color: GreenStyle: Bluetooth speaker

Initially, I was impressed by its aesthetics. However, my experience quickly soured as the battery stopped working, making it the fifth quality problem I've encountered with a product from this brand.In all honesty, I found this Bang & Olufsen speaker to be disappointing. The brand's reputation suggests top-tier products, but this speaker left much to be desired. The fact that this is my fifth quality problem with a Bang & Olufsen product strongly suggests a recurring issue with their quality control and reliability.While the designs and external materials are undeniably cool and visually appealing, it's clear that the internal components don't match up. When it comes to speakers, the sound quality is paramount, and in this aspect, I was underwhelmed. The claim that older products from competitors like Bose, Marshall, JBL, and Sony perform better and offer superior sound quality even with cheaper exterior materials holds weight based on my experience.In conclusion, I would caution potential buyers to think twice before investing in expensive products from the Bang & Olufsen brand. While they excel in aesthetics, the quality and performance of their speakers may not meet your expectations, and the fact that this is my fifth quality problem with their products suggests a larger issue within the brand. There are more reliable alternatives available in the market.","Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2023",AGR7LJUYQZ5HEIV24E6S6WXHSUTQ,True,12,Color: GreenStyle: Bluetooth speaker

R2TB41OYEQ665X,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply great.,Jake,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my entire ownership of this speaker.Time of writing this review is roughly 8 months after purchase, having used this speaker practically every single day since. This was a replacement for a very well-loved but somewhat lacking B&O (P3?) oval-shaped speaker that inspired of few of my must-have features.My key requirements in purchasing a speaker at this price point were:- Punchy, solid bass, with high accuracy, clear playback throughout most of the volume range- Relatively attractive, understated, simple design with ergonomic and intuitive controls- Easily oriented for high quality playback in a variety of different situations (facing sideways, upwards, at angles)- Long-lasting battery without any obnoxious constant playback interruptions informing you of battery life remainingThis speaker delivers on all of these.The bass is incredibly clear, with no horrible warbling and distortion that’s very common with dozens of other similar speakers. The audio playback is very crisp and clear, with no noticeable quality losses. I’m sure it’s not perfect, but it’s more than adequate for 95%+ of people. Even at low volumes, the quality is still extremely high. There is a usable, enjoyable sound at every volume level.The design is simple, but handsome. It does not look obnoxious or out of place anywhere. It is just the right size, not too large to pop into a bag, and not too small as to have low-power drivers with poor sound. Very easy to transport. The squared design makes it very stable on most surfaces, but is still rounded enough not to get caught on things. The controls are very easy to understand, even the multi-device Bluetooth cycling and syncing. I have no complaints.The speaker works well for playback in nearly any position, especially when placed on a table or other nice playback surface. It can be placed facing upward, and the speaker enhances playback for all-around sound. When placed horizontally, the same happens for directional playback. Very impressive stability in a wide variety of situations. Some would consider the lack of a lanyard or string to be a downside for this point, but there is massive benefits to keeping this speaker on a surface.The battery life is incredible. Vastly longer than I had really expected for this speaker. With my personal usage (middle volume range, 2-3 uses a day for 30 to 60 minutes at a time), I usually recharge every 1-2 weeks. Not sure what exactly that equates to in real playback time, but I still find it impressive. The speaker will notify you at 20% and 10% battery level, which is exactly what I wanted. Many other speakers will interrupt playback at 75%, 50%, etc. I’ve not experienced any noticeable battery decay during my ownership, but I have only fully depleted and nearly fully recharged the entire time, with no “filling up” in between.Downsides do exist, but most are inconsequential for me.- The audible indicators that inform you of which device you are connected to can sometimes feel a bit sluggish, especially with long device names.- I feel the price point is still a bit on the high side for the value, but I feel I’ve more than gotten my money’s worth. I just like a good deal.- Volume occasionally spikes very high in certain scenarios when switching between devices, but is fairly easily turned down after a quick scare.I would highly recommend this speaker to anyone in the market for a speaker at this price point. This is an especially good deal on sale. If you’re still reading at this point, just get the damn thing on the way.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AHZBIFMKWWZHILYEIYOSP4AIA37Q,True,255,Color: Black

I’m not going to lie, I had low expectations and planned on returning it. After opening it and setting it up, I got to see what the hype was about. Took me a couple hours of listening to figure out if it was a bang for my buck or a waste of money.I currently have the first UE Megaboom that I use daily that I bought back in 2016. It’s loud, has bass and can fill a room. Sadly, the charge isn’t exactly reliable so I was looking for something new. The Bose Link Flex definitely has a great quality sound. It will definitely fill a room. I like to use mine in the shower and acoustically in the shower the bass just sounds amazing!! Speaker actually fell off the shelf from the bass and survived the fall.Now, I listen to just about every genre of music. I found it to sound best with Latin music. Vocals are super clear. When it came to rap music (or music with lots of bass) I found it to sound perfectly balanced when the volume was at about 75%. Above that you’ll definitely still get volume but the bass will take a seat back. I’m used to the UE Megaboom that has 360 sound. While the Bose Link Flex will fill a room, the sound seems more straight forward depending if you want to stand it up or lay it down.Bose App is decent. Doesn’t really have any equalizer setting on there if that’s what you’re loooking for.I got this because it is small enough to pack in a carry on and not take up too much space in my bag. Might I add, it’s almost the same size as my iPhone 14 Pro Max . I can easily carry both in one hand. Easy to say, I’m going to keep this speaker with me. Now let’s see if the battery life is legit. I’ll check back in.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AF35A3ETTRWH62AWEWFQ2GO27VJA,True,26,Color: Cypress Green
R2Y3WBHYS3U0M4,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars A premium speaker in a sturdy package.,Reviewer MHM 3-5,5,"I bought this speaker because I wanted a way to listen to music while grilling in my backyard. I had no expectations of it being a “party” speaker or anything of the like.But my goodness. This speaker punched above the weight I expected and what reviewers claim. They say it’s good for less than 10 people. Probably true if in an enclosed space.Outside, standing in the corner of my backyard about 40+ feet away, the speaker volume is at about 60-70% and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker, and the vocals are clear, the instruments are clear, and there’s even some punch of the bass. It’s so much more potent than I expected.I actually bought a second one (the one pictured) so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode, and then these are far better than they have any right to be. The bass shook through the house at about 40% volume, to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day. 😂So (for now), I’m obliging and returning one, but honestly, I don’t want to. One of these speakers are great. Two make a great portable stereo system.Now for the feature set. Key selling points for me were:1. Durability. It’s made of steel and silicone, is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust. You can enjoy this in the yard, on your workbench, swimming, shower, etc. I live in high desert, and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn’t have a single dent or scratch. Which leads me to…2. The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning, so the sound quality was maintained even if it’s on its back, side, or face down. None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge.3. Unlike other products that I considered, this sounded good right out of the box. Anker (Soundcore) offers some great competition in this segment, but needs the EQ tweaked to shine. They’re not bad by any means, but I wanted things to just be simple. Power on and go without fuss. Bose delivered that.There are similar products for sure. Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo, but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did.We already covered Soundcore. Tweak with the EQ, save some money, you’ll likely be happy.These speakers do often go on sale, and I purchased mine used (like new) and refurbished respectively. The “Used” unit was actually brand new from Amazon, broke the seals on the box and everything. Far as I could tell, the speaker just rolled around in someone’s trunk unopened before returning. The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents, broken seals, and all accessories were obviously also unopened.Refurbished unit came straight from Bose. Also came with all accessories and literature, just a box that was labeled “Refurbished”. Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless.I bring this up to encourage you to save some money, reduce some e-waste, and buy secondhand like I did. No judgments if you want to go new of course! But I got 2 speakers, one that was new in reality, essentially $100 off the set, and I didn’t miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty.$150 is pricey for a speaker, but $103 for a Bose speaker is not. Especially one that can literally go for a swim.Four criticisms I’d like y’all to know. First, compression above about 75% volume. Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole. In reality, that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile. No big deal unless you’re blasting EDM, Hip-Hop, the like. As I said, this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70% was more than enough to fill my backyard.Second criticism is no biggie for me, but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition. I didn’t want to fuss with an EQ, but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound. Consequentially, the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode (not required).Third criticism is truly a nitpick, but why do I have two apps for my Bose products? Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers? Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app. You could easily knock out criticisms 3-4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app, like my QuietComfort Headphones, and this VERY speaker's big brother, the Soundlink Flex Max, is already there. Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music, with a basic EQ like the others?Fourth, this uses outdated Bluetooth. No big deal. Pairs easily. But don’t expect to watch movies or game off of this. Latency is too high.Anyhow, enough of that. Go buy one. Or better yet, two. You won’t be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AH5F7QHDE5VKRAMBN43A5WPU4ADQ,True,121,Color: Black
RTTQUD9NY9L3G,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars Way better than expected!,Rich,5,"The last time I tried Bose speakers was about 25 years ago and I swore them off completely because I didn't like their signature sound. After reading all of the glowing reviews and watching many, many speaker reviews on YT, I decided to give the Soundlink Flex a try as a replacement for my aging Sony SRS-X3. I initially purchased the Beosound A1 (2nd Gen), which has superior mid and high sound quality IMO, but had to return because the it was very underpowered. Where the Flex can easily fill a 500 sq ft space, the A1 provided incredibly low sound at a distance of 15 ft. The Flex puts out more bass, if not more than the A1, and the bass offers more punch at lower Hz than the A1. The overall sound is great for the price but would be really nice if the app included an equalizer to help push up the mids and highs.Prior to purchasing the Flex on Amazon and trying to save a buck, I bought the Flex SE from Costco thinking it was the same product that was just repackaged. After 15 minutes of trying to use as a speakerphone, I finally figured out that the SE does not have a built-in microphone and therefore cannot be used as a speakerphone. So, I immediately returned the SE and bought the non-SE here.","Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2024",AHWOBQMLF2N4Z4TCEPMHAL4ASVHQ,True,0,Color: White Smoke
R3TVEXDLBORXWI,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars 5 Million Stars!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,Caitriona Gillespie,5,"OMG this is the best speaker which is not a huge floor speaker (over 1 foot high) that is part of a massive speaker system. The sound quality is truly impressive for a speaker of any size, & I think that if I bought another one, which I'm seriously considering, it would rival my Kenwood stereo system, which has two floor speakers that are over a foot high each, & the Kenwood amplifier, & the Kenwood 5-CD player. All that stuff is so big that it needs its own cabinet & takes up several feet of floor space. I don't know how the geniuses at Bose have done it, but they have somehow packed all that sound into a speaker less than half the size of a loaf of bread that is also a very appealing shade of lilac that goes with my décor. The Bluetooth connection works perfectly every time, even though I don't have the newest phone out there. I'm so in love with this speaker, the only complaint I have is purely aesthetic & easily fixed- the fabric loop attached to this beautiful lilac speaker is, for some unknown reason, an entirely ridiculous shade of brilliant orange, which clashes hideously with everything. I solved this problem with a dark purple Sharpie marker. That is the only complaint I have. While this speaker comes without any instructions on how to set it up, the set up is so easy, even when you're not a technology person, that I set it up myself with no help in under a minute. I plugged it in, turned it on, turned the volume all the way up- for some idiotic reason, it comes with the volume all the way down- & then turned on the Bluetooth on my phone & had it search for Bluetooth devices. My phone found the speaker very quickly, paired with it without issue, & started playing. One important thing to know is that when you leave the range of the speaker for an extended period of time, like when I leave for work & take my phone with me, the speaker will turn that connection off, so that when I get home & want to use my speaker again, I need to go over to the speaker with my phone & push the power button once. The speaker will say how much battery power is left & that it is now connected to my phone- I don't turn the Bluetooth off on my phone when I leave the house. I recommend turning the speaker all the way up & then controlling the volume through your phone, which is what I do. I think that's the easiest way to do it. One charge of the battery lasts a long time- at least 12 hours, so that part's great as well. Just buy it already, you won't regret it. It'll beat the pants off of all of your other speakers, even if you already have a nice set of Bose speakers.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AGKOCRUHY2FG2ZHWTZRUH5JYIFBA,True,26,Color: Chilled Lilac

R27NSEA4YJAF9R,B0CP7YLJ21,4.0 out of 5 stars DOSS SoundBox Ultra Bluetooth Speaker,MC,4,"Here is a speaker that I like for a couple of reasons.1, is that it has this clean, retro look. You can place it anywhere and it sort of blends in, but yet still adds a little bit of style to any area, and 2, is this clean sound that it produces.I will emphasize that many companies are starting to use the word ""BASS"" in their products description, because they know that it attracts the attention of the buyer. Many time they will over state the products function by using words or phrases such as ""Powerful Bass"", ""Mega Bass"", ""Booming Bass"", or ""Extreme Bass"" and their product will fall short, or may produce muddy sounds and low clarity.In this case, I will say that this speaker has moderate bass, and you will get a nicer and fuller sound it you place it in a corner on an angle, to help with the sound response and bass reflection.It also produces a pretty clean sound. I like to enjoy music when I listen to it and the only way to do that is to have nice mids and very clear highs.“BASS SHOULD BE A COMPLIMENT TO YOUR MUSIC, NOT THE STAR OF IT”!This speaker has very nice sound and style, with a decent compliment of bass. I enjoy it on my weekend mornings, sort of as a calming vibe. The bass is not overpowering, and the songs I play can be heard at an enjoyable clarity.

R3MIAOES1GMS8H,B0CP7YLJ21,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Nuanced Sound,imsureitsfine,4,"The media could not be loaded. Audio being such a subjective thing is sometimes hard to review. With that in mind, the thing that stuck out to me most when starting to use this speaker was the overall balance and nuance to the sound profile. I've spend my fair share of time with other speakers and I find that they often tend to tune their speakers as very bass heavy to make it feel like that they are more ""powerful"" than some others. The DOSS speaker, while perfectly capable of hitting some good lows, does a great creating an even soundscape and doesn't drown out everything in muddy bass. Out of the box, I find it to be very pleasant across a variety of music genres. There is aIt does get plenty loud, and will easily fill a modest sized room. I haven't specifically timed playtime but I have been able to make it through two days of work and a medium volume without charging. I'm using it primarily via the Bluetooth connection although there is a 3.5mm for direct connection.Construction wise, I think it feels good. Very hefty and not at all hollow feeling. The ""wood on the sides is nice enough visually but the right side of mine it slightly indented for some reason. You can feel it more than you can actually see it. I like the overall minimal look and the button dial up top is functional. To that point, I do wish the volume was more of an analogue dial you could rotate as the volume intervals aren't quite as precise as I would like. You can always use the slider on your device to achieve a more exact level but it would be nice to do this from the device. Also, there is skip or back button. You can pause and play with the larger center button.This also supports linking two units for better separation. I only have one though so I can't comment on how well that works. The BASS-M button seems to increase the low end a bit when you press and hold it. At lower volumes I think it is effective, but when it is louder, I don't think it is necessary.Although DOSS may not be the first speaker brand that comes to mind, I'm quite impressed with their approach to sound. I like the playtime, sound design, minimal look, and mostly good construction. I think their buttons could be better but are serviceable. Given the price (as of this review) of almost $180 I think it might be hard to justify compared to some others on the market. That said, if you listen to one of these, the sound performance might be good enough to make it worthwhile. I'm quite happy with it despite some minor flaws.","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2024",AHNWO5R6A2P4GSRUPEDJMO3XSPRQ,False,6,Color: Gray

It does play quite loud and overall sound quality is clear and definitely better than the smaller portable speakers I've tested. I found it interesting that this speaker came with a battery given the size. I would have rather given up the battery and given it a larger or extra bass driver or echo chamber to improve low end punch. Unfortunately, as is, it's in an awkward middle spot of ""too big to travel with"" and ""don't want to leave it plugged in because of battery"".

The midrange is great, the highs aren't piercingly annoying, and the bass is good for its size.Notes:-All testing using audio being sent via Bluetooth from a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra using Tidal on the highest settings for all tracks.-Best overall sound quality tests were performed at 2/3 volume level via Bluetooth.-This speaker's ""perceived"" sound quality seems to be *very* dependent on the music being played back.Positives:-Loud. More than enough power to fill a large bedroom, living room, etc. You can feel it moving air.-The midrange and highs are really nice and clear, even at higher levels, without being obnoxious like on pretty much every other spearer of this size I've tried.-It handles classical music extremely well, as long as it doesn't dip into the lows very far.-An absolutely fantastic solution for limited space when in need of better sound than what you TV can output.-Connecting via Bluetooth is super easy with everything from Windows, iOS, and Android, I had zero issues.-USB-A port for thumb drives-USB-C rechargeable-Micro SD card slot.-Line in.-Metal speaker mounts.-Single-piece metal front/top/back, good looking wood-grain effect plastic sides.-Simple top buttons are easy to use to control the speaker.-Supports dual-speaker playback, allowing 2 to be paired to the same audio source.Music Tests:-Whilst this speaker does have more bass than similar-sized speakers I have tried, it's nowhere near ""deep"" per the listing.-It cannot, in any way, handle a track like Daft Punk's ""Musique"", the changing/sweeping bass/mid parts in the track, it just gets lost 100% and makes it sound like pure trash at anything but low volume.-Contrasting that, it handles Daft Punk's ""Around the World"" acceptably at about 2/3 volume without running into distortion.-X Ambassador's ""Hold You Down"" loses its very impactful bass, unfortunately, but otherwise still sounds good.-Whilst it doesn't have the hard-hitting bass that's possible, Earth, Wind & Fire's ""Let's Grove"" is reproduced respectfully.-It handles Lindsey Stirling's ""First Light"" and ""Eye of the Untold Her"" extremely well, even cranked up, without distorting. Whilst the bass isn't ""there"" as it would be if these tracks were being pumped through a stereo with large speakers, or even a high-end pair of headphones, the fact is can still sound good playing these tracks is impressive.-Claire de Lune sounds great cranked up about 2/3 of the way, handling the nuances of the piano fine. Anyone else think certain music in the Zelda series of video games reminds you of Claire de Lune, or is that just me??-Cream's ""Sunshine of Your Love"" sounds great, even able to make out the stereo separation of the track extremely well, which is surprising for something this small.Other Audio Tests:-Makes TV shows and YouTube audio sound fantastic as it handles voice extremely well.-As long as you're not playing a game with massive explosions, video games are reproduced great.Considerations:-To get more bass out of the speaker and to project the sound more, place the back close to a solid object/wall or to make it even better, put it in a corner. Doing so can have drastic improvements on the sound.Negatives:-As mentioned above, this speaker can sound amazing, and then like trash, depending on the music it's playing. The best example being the contrast between Daft Punk tracks. The sub just starts rumbling at higher volume, unfortunately.Overall:-I find listening to this speaker to be very pleasant over long periods of time, even at high volume.-This DOSS speaker handles the midrange up highs far, far better than every other Bluetooth speaker I've tested in the sub-$150 range.-Don't get this if you're looking for bass, you *will* be disappointed. At high volumes, the bass goes into muddiness zone or it kinda just stops putting anything out.In Closing:-For the normal 'list price' of $179.99, there are better options available. If you can pick this up for the current $129.99 with the $10 coupon, bringing it down to $119.99, I'd highly recommend it.This review is for ""DOSS SoundBox Ultra Bluetooth Speaker with 2.1 Sound Channel Audio, 80W Superior Sound with Deep Bass, Two DSP Technologies, 18H Playtime, Bluetooth 5.3, Wireless Speaker for Home, Office, Livingroom""","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2024",AE7RH2BM22UZAZTXSJUF2ZGXSKSA,False,2,Color: Gray

R371WQ6DPA1H8A,B0CP7YLJ21,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good speaker, fills a niche very well",Tee,4,"I love that companies are making ""indoor"" bluetooth speakers that go with decor and prioritize sound and looks vs. how waterproof and how many LED's they can throw on them. This Doss fits that indoor niche and I appreciate what it is. It is a 2.1 speaker in that it has true left/right drivers and a subwoofer built in. The speaker is wide enough and you will hear a bit of stereo separation if positioned in front of it.It also has a 3.5mm jack so you could hook up an external source to it also (Chromecast, CD Player, record player, FM/AM radio, etc). I am glad they included this as it makes the speaker vastly more flexible and not just reliant on bluetooth connections. If you don't have a lot of room this might be a good solution for you if you want a small directly-connected vinyl setup without having to resort to the lossy bluetooth protocol.Sound-wise, it does sound good. Not the best I've heard, but good. It's punchy-ish, it's stereo and it could easily fill a room up. Doss advertises a 35hz bottom end. I played a few test tracks and 60hz and 50hz were very audible, but it started falling off significantly at 40hz. Also, the bass is ""flabby"" on those low notes. I compared to my benchmark favorite sounding bluetooth speaker of all time, the Sony XB43, and the Sony has way tighter and more tuneful/musical bass at those lower frequencies. An EDM speaker the Doss is not.Now, the problem with the $179 price (at the time of this writing) is that there are a lot of good bluetooth speakers in that range and even better bluetooth speakers that are completely separate cabinets so you can spread apart and get a proper stereo image. My Sony XB43 compensates for this with a ""live 3D"" stereo mode, which works well in helping broaden the soundstage. The Doss only has a bass boost (which does indeed boost the bass a touch and I have been running with that ""on"" since I don't listen at high volumes) but nothing more to help the soundstage. The Doss sounds far more ""thin and narrow"" than the Sony XB43 does (perhaps an unfair comparison since MSRP's were different, but the Sony was $199 toward the end of its life).The Doss does have TWS so you could pair two of them for stereo and my guess is that'd likely sound really good. But that's a $360 total investment and there are a lot of really good options in that price range as well. With that said, I likely would not recommend that (for price reasons) unless you really, really like this speaker.I have the ""Gold"" color and it's more of a platinum/champagne color, which I really like. It has a certain retro appeal. However, I am not a huge fan of the faux wood vinyl on the sides (I suppose that's retro too, but not necessarily in a good way), especially at this price point. I'd expect faux woodgrain on a $40 speaker, not a $180 speaker. I could have done without the ""Doss"" logo in the middle of the grill as well; seems like it'd of been more at home in a corner or on the top. Also, I'd have preferred a few knobs on the top vs. the push button interface for everything...every time I want to adjust something I need to get out the manual and look up what to do. Knobs would likely help with that. That's all me nitpicking this though. It does work well as-is and still looks good, all things considered.Overall, I like the niche that this speaker fills and I like the approach they took with it. It definitely sounds very good overall. It's about $180 though, which is not an inexpensive purchase and it has some stiff competition in that price range. If this fits your need, I can certainly recommend it as I think most will like the sound it produces. I really hope the trend continues to offer high-quality speakers, such as this, designed for indoor usage. A black rubber coated large speaker looks completely out-of-place in most dining, living, bed, etc. rooms and the color choices offered on this Doss will blend into most decors with ease.My only issues with the speaker is the somewhat flabby bass below 60hz and the soundstage is narrow compared to class-leaders. The faux woodgrain cheapens the look on the ""Gold"" version as it's made well otherwise with the metal casing.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024",AGOT7D3GZFVAZMP5VJUXVODL3U2A,False,4,Color: Gold

The bluetooth signal is strong and doesn't drop out when I move the speaker. It was very easy to hook up to my computer. The speaker was found and added quickly. No problems at all with that.It charges quickly and holds it for a very long time. I can have it on all day and into the evening and it still shows it has power left. I plug it in to recharge nightly but I could easily go a couple of days playing and not run out of power.It's an attractive speaker that doesn't take up a lot of room. Always good when today we all have so many bluetooth, wireless gadgets that take up our desk space. I'm using this as my primary speaker and did away with my old system of a woofer and two speakers. It sounds better than they did and has the added bonus of being able to grab it and take it anywhere within my home.This speaker is solid and weighty. You'd think it was much more expensive than it is. At this time it's on sale for $129.99 plus an extra $10 off! So not bad at all for what you'll be getting. I'm thinking of buying another to take to another part of my house so I can just use it from there. I recommend this speaker to anyone wanting portable sound or even stationary.

The system I've been using for the last few years sounds great but has a large bass cabinet, two stereo speakers and they are all wired together. Including the cable for the volume control and it's plugged in. This has really turned my desktop into a traffic jam. When I saw the SoundBox and read the specs I saw a possible solution to this situation. And it looks and sounds great. I do have stereo sound. Very clean and crisp highs and warm midtones. The bass was not as boomy as I was expecting but was perfectly balanced with the rest of the sound. My guess is really cranked up the bass would be boomier. This is a great sleek looking unit with a modest footprint. Especially considering the mess it replaced and the actual desktop space freed up. I'm indoors in my office so I've never gotten close to cranking it all the way up. It is clear tho this can definitely rock the house so to speak. And at the loudest I've had it there is no vibration, hiss, nothing but sweet clean sound. The SoundBox is behind my monitor but via bluetooth I can control all the volume from my keyboard. SoundBox will turn itself off if not in use after 15minutes. This is a great looking unit that has made my office a so much nicer place to work and play.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024",AHZVZFBCYKNK3XPPJJIPLVYB6KKQ,False,2,Color: Gray

The thing I really like about the speaker, other than the great sound, is how simple it was to pair two of them together. Simply turn them on and push the pairing button on top.

But I move around too; office, dining room, kitchen, patio, pool, etc. I also have a travel speaker that I have been using; it sounds great “for the size…” But at home, do I really need a travel-size footprint speaker or can I upgrade the sound quality if I upgrade the footprint. Why listen for reduced sound quality when I don’t have the same constraints?And that is where this comes in. I can move to Dining Room, Office, Patio, etc. It is portable. And with it being rechargeable I don’t even need a power outlet. I wouldn’t put this in my suitcase, but I have this covered with my travel speaker. The sound upgrade => totally worth it.As to the claim of 18-hours playtime; I put that to the test. Full charge, I have 18-hours now and the low-charge red LED is still not on. I would caution this means you turn power off when not using; standby keeps it on and looking for a connection and this reduced my playtime to six (6) hours.

However, it offers several drawbacks that are definitely worth considering. At this price point, I believe there are better options available.What's good:• Small form factor, will fit on any counter top or shelf.• Easy pairing - immediately connected with an iPhone, a Mac computer, and an Android phone in my testing.• Reasonably good bass - though it's drastically affectedy by where you place this speaker. For best results, I found putting it on an empty shelf in a bookshelf (so it was in something of an alcove) helped enhance the bass response considerably.• Good battery life. I've listened to this for hours without fully charging it yet. If you need something portable for a party or similar where it'll be on for several hours at a time, this is a good option.What's not good:• Overall sound response. The most important job of any speaker is to reproduce sound as well as possible, and this little speaker needs some improvement. The mids are hollow and echoey, and the highs are so muted/muffled as to make me wonder if there is something actually wrong with it. I compared this head to head with several other small bluetooth speakers I own, and while this one had more bass than the rest, it sounded worse in all other respects compared to them all.• Cheesy plastic fake wood grain. This may look ok from across the room, but up close it's obvious this is in a plastic case. The wood grain looks and feels very fake.• Cheap construction: The whole thing appears to have just been snapped together. I did not take it entirely apart to see exactly how it was assembled, but the fake wood sides clearly just snap into the rest of the case.Overally, this is just ok. It'll fill a good sized living room or kitchen with music/podcasts, and the portability is great.

Normally this would make it a 4/5, despite the price, but where I have a problem with is the control itself. I don't care that the buttons are flush, but knobs really would've made this work better, because it's hard to tell what the settings are, as there are no app controls or screen to indicate data.Secondly, the aux port is messed up. I was going crazy trying to get it to work, swapping in multiple aux cables only to find that the device only recognizes the aux setting when it's plugged in 3/4 of the way...and at that point the sound is unrecognizable.

Early units from years ago had a separate bass box and a tangle of cords. No more; simple Bluetooth hookup.My 79 year old ears have lived through too many rock concerts and I need a mid-range boost. So when I plugged this unit in, the bass was fantastic revelation to hear (and feel) once again...but too much bottom is muddy ...for me. Young ears will love this.I adjusted with the EQ to lower bass a bit, boost the voice bands, and WOW! Now the old feeling was back!This unit has some weight to it, not plasticy feel.

R3VSPQWFC53BWQ,B0CP7YLJ21,"3.0 out of 5 stars Loud, bass heavy tabletop",E.Swope,3,"I should preference my review by saying that my personal preference is for balanced full range sound, and that I have distinct audiophile leanings. I have tried a number of Doss speakers over the past several years and have, by and large, thought pretty highly of them. Among upcoming brands which produce bass heavy/ extra bass speakers Doss is a standout. Their sound and build quality is generally better than comparably priced speaker in tat space.This speak IS loud, and it has a bass heavy profile even without the bass boost switched on. When I first turned it on the sound was rougher than I expected (knowing the brand) but after and hour or so of burn in it smoothed out quite a lot. Still, this is not what I would call a balanced profile. The pounding bass made REM sound like a dance (club) band. Things which leaned towards folk or jazz just did not sound right. The highs and mids are not so good, and the bass edge just does not work with some music. Again, I am talking about the basic profile with extra bass switched off..I should mention that in terms of features, this speaker has line in, an sd cards slot, and usb for use with flash drives. By contrast, other BT speakers in this price range, and comparably priced tabletop speakers I have tried, have wifi for streaming music. The speaker also lacks lossless blue tooth codecs, also found in speakers in this price range.While I was tempted to rate this 4 stars because of my prior experience with the band, I had my husband (a musician and audio engineer) listen to it and he shrugged and said ""just average"". This is the 4th tabletop I have tried this year. The others were from JBL, Marshall, and Klipsch. Fact is that all of them are better. Normally I would say that's not a fair comparison, but, given that the retail pricing on this speaker and the Klipsch are $20 apart, and that the Klipsch has a dynamic range of 20 hz to 22,000 khz, (This speaker is 35-25) there really is no comparison, except on price. I am not sure if that was the second or third speaker (or set of speakers) I have bought from Klipsch this year... to be honest I do not know what's going on but their speakers are a steal at the present time, while I think this particular Doss speaker is priced out of it's milieau.Others will undoubtedly like this speaker better than I do. If you are looking for something loud, with a bass heavy profile, you will like this speaker better than I. To my mind it performs like one of Doss's outdoor party speakers; only the shape is different.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024",AGASAFHLQKQP7RNG76TKN4GPBJBQ,False,0,Color: Gold

Sound quality is great, bass is good, and it’s super rugged and can hold up to drops, dropping in water or splashing, and even dirt and sand! The battery also lasts a long time and the speaker gets super loud, like this thing sounds better than my tvs built in speakers. My only complaints are that the eq isn’t super adjustable with only 3 levels for bass mids and treble. I wish there was at least a little loop or something built in to carry it too, and I wish the usb a port in the back was usb c. I also wish the usb c port was recessed with the other usb port and covered by the rubber flap so that sand or dirt wouldn’t get in it. Other than that, there’s really nothing else I could ask for in a speaker.

Individually, those are great. But PartyBoost just doesn't work properly. Pops and thuds. Sound dropping completely. I'm no audiophile, and I honestly can't tell all that much of a difference in sound quality between the Charge 5 and the Flip 5, but I can say that I listened to music all day long using the Charge 5 as the base speaker for PartyBoost and had 0 issues with all the headaches that the Flips have been giving me.Basically, if you like the Flip, this has a bigger battery, marginally better sound, better IPX rating, and can be used to charge your phone in an pinch. It also uses Bluetooth 5 instead of the Flip's Bluetooth 4.2, which is probably a good chunk of the reason PartyBoost works better.Still no aux in, which is a mild bummer, but not a deal breaker. (The only thing I 'need' aux in for is currently using my Boombox 2, which conveniently has one!) No voice chat, which is a complete non-issue for me, but seems to be a pain point for a lot of folks.The case is nice, but I don't see myself needing it all that much for travel. I saw multiple people complaining about the speaker not fitting while others had no issue. I am fairly certain it is entirely related to what orientation you put the speaker in the case. Put it in the right way and it zips up no issue!Note: The Charge 5 does NOT come with a wall wart. You still get a USB A to USB C connector to charge it with, but you'll need to use an existing wall wart you already own. (I have seen complaints about this as well. But I have like 7 of them plugged in and another 10 or so sitting around as spares.)","Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2021",AE7N2ACQHBB3J4PPIM7D3DXGRKXQ,True,26,Style: Charge 5 + Divvi CaseColor: Blue

My Charge 4 goes in the stereo very quickly. These Charge 5 is haphazard and confusing. I could get it in stereo mode but it would take me 3 to 4 minutes going back-and-forth and back-and-forth until it went in to stereo mode. I called Support and the gentleman knew less than me about it. When I told him my problem, he would repeat it back incorrectly. I explained the problem again and he repeated it back incorrectly. After the third time, he did repeat it back correctly, but then said he would be back which I assuming he was googling how to do it. After dealing him for about 10 minutes, I finally gave up and told him it would be great if the JBL support team knew a little bit about their products. I can get them in the stereo mode now, but it still takes several minutes for it to go into that mode Which is nothing like the charge 4. I’d probably give the sound a 4 and the support a 0 so I guess since it’s a speaker and the sound is most important and it basically almost does what I needed it to, (but it just takes a while) i’ll round it two or 3.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AGNCY44CFNRQOM5ISWOXYQU7SOUA,True,0,Style: Charge 5 + Divvi CaseColor: Gray

It allows everyone with a smart phone to play their favorite artist or mix and is loud enough to fill a room. Neither the dynamic range (noticable roll off on the deep bass end and a tweeter that is harsh until it breaks in and still sounds better from a distance) nor the accuracy are anything to write home about but that's really not the point. The point is to have fun, make noise and enjoy yourself. This speaker gets it done.One note, the Charge 5 is a bit ""kidney"" shaped vs the Charge 4. The supplied case that you get (for free) fits the Charge 5 much better if you turn it upside down with the ""foot"" facing up.

RL16ZWDRDNUEI,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars Great product with usage caveats,Omar Enrique Ferrer,5,"A few months ago I had an epiphany. When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house, and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music.Today, I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker (don't tell my dad, he would be ashame of me).So I started to get better equipment. Now, I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor, so, big amplifiers and so are out of the question, but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers, so I tried the Marshall Emberton II.To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement. With out-of-the-box settings, the sound is more than detailed. 80s and 90s music sound outstanding although, Peter Cetera's Glory of Love and Toto's Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before, they are sharp and strong, sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound (keywords here, really, just a little).This brings me to my first recommendation: do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don't know what you are doing. This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings (more on this later). I have youtube music and amazon prime music (yeah, I know, no spotify), and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass, to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack sounded specially dreadful, as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music. I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat. It was a different performance altogether. I could ever hear some slight effects they used, that I had not noticed before.Now, one down for the application. Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair, which was seamless and impressive (it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window, so, it looks cool), but the application takes forever to actually ""discover"" the device, even when it is already paired.When it finally discover it (which was not too long, but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker), the application notified me of a firmware upgrade, which I proceeded to install. The installation failed miserably, so, I temporarily stopped that effort, which I retook successfully a day later. The update was surprisingly big in size, taking around 5 minutes to download, and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting, which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with, but it went through, and after that, the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker.To end that topic, the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming, with only three modes: Marshall, Voice and Push, of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality.Lesson learned: unless too picky, when using this speaker, leave your apps equalizers on flat, their profile is that good.Now, to the hardware itself, people will notice this little wonder. Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius, and the brass button on top is the cherry on top. Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction (power, volume, forward-back, bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button, which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently). If we can handle touch control on over-head and in-ear speakers, this button is a piece of cake.My only complain in this department is that, at least for me, an old guy, the signs indicating the functions around the button, being carved in the black speaker, which has texture, are for all intent and purposes invisible, but once you get accustomed, an use the logo as a positional reference that's not a problem anymore.And finally, the little caveat. Single speaker, stereo sound. Let that sink in.Done? Ok, they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively (or was it the other way around? well, you get my point). Stereo suffers a little (not too much) because both sources are incredibly close, but it brings this caveat. This speaker should not be set as others, against walls, like in shelf, and so, because you end up drowning one side.The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage, and if you want to appreciate the sound, you should point one side (not the front or back) to you. that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance.If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price, I definitely recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022",AEFUDKDNGZTOEP2BCFB4CLUELCYQ,True,168,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II
R1WRMQNY9KE109,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars Simple yet Wonderful,Sunny,5,"The Marshall Emberton is a testament to Marshall's commitment to quality and innovation. It seamlessly blends timeless design with cutting-edge technology, delivering a speaker that not only looks stunning but also sounds exceptional. The iconic Marshall logo adorns the front, paying homage to the brand’s heritage.Portability and Convenience: The Emberton’s compact size, weighing just 0.7 kilograms, makes it incredibly portable. Slip it into your bag or pocket, and you have a powerful sound system wherever you go.Sound Performance: Don’t be fooled by its size; the Emberton packs a punch. With two 10W drivers, it delivers a surprisingly rich and dynamic sound. The bass is deep and satisfying, the mids are clear, and the highs are crisp, offering a well-balanced audio experience. Even at high volumes, the sound remains distortion-free, showcasing Marshall’s commitment to audio excellence.In conclusion, the Marshall Emberton is a testament to Marshall’s engineering prowess. It defies its size, delivering a sound quality that rivals much larger speakers. Its robust build, impressive battery life, and excellent sound make it a top choice in the realm of portable Bluetooth speakers. Whether you’re a music enthusiast, a frequent traveller, or someone who values premium audio in a compact form, the Marshall Emberton is a stellar choice.","Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2023",AEB5JEKNO3NNDOMDWCOKF2H3WDJA,True,24,Color: BlackStyle: Emberton
R1PKWJ1ZABTB2S,B09XXW54QG,"5.0 out of 5 stars Love, love, love, and love...",Su Doki,5,"So good, I bought two instead of one Marshall Middleton. As wanted, I pair them together to get surround sound, smaller size, and save about $50. Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I'm taking with me to Heaven, at that time - it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers. That's because I already own a pair of off-brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, etc. They have all the other bells-and-whistles specifications, including USB-C, rapid charging, 20+ hours playtime and only cost $30 each. The seller stopped selling them on Amazon.Emberton II was a huge jump in price. The difference from Emberton I - is it will pair with other Marshall speakers. But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs. Also, the Emberton II has a grain texture finish. The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products. Knock-offs provide knock-off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews. I won't describe the differences in great details. The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides. It looks and feels real money, very expensively printed. Inside packaging and booklets too. The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid. The grills are finished very well, individually, without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem. Look closely.The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres. It's a work of art pumping out sound, spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices, to hear them together in one song. This is studio quality at a reasonable price. It exceeds my $30 pair, which already beat-out all the other more expensive speakers, in the only way it could. I heard sounds playing in music I've heard so many times, I can replay it verbatim in my head. Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison. But if I'm completely satisfied at $30 or $170 - no one can entice me to spend $1500 or $15,000 I can afford to pay too. I might purchase more Emberton II's to install wireless speakers throughout the house. For now, I'm pretty satisfied.","Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2023",AFG3MMBXL5ODHUR3EXHWYGOHLNXA,True,22,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

I bought this Em II to mainly listen to my true crime podcasts in my bedroom. Easy & seamless Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 14max. Easy straightforward use for controls on the unit. I really didn’t need to look at the instructions with that. Smooth use there.To test the sound quality I streamed some mesic. The sound quality for music is fine’ish considering the size of speaker. It’s fine for background music if you’re flexible on sound quality as long as you don’t play loudly, at that point the music will frazzle out. So limited, not surprising. Podcast quality is definitely an improvement from my phone’s speaker and in line with the price point, in general. I think it should be about $25 less. The app is useless. I guess I expected something from the app. I’m at a loss for the point of it. I tried it out on my phone. It continued so say my phone Bluetooth was not on. Even as I was literally playing music through it. I did all the stuff. Restart, reconnect etc. Reviewed the booklet, Nothing. Everything re the speaker and phone working fine. But what is the point of the app? I interpreted from the manual that I should download the app to get extra features. Maybe bass and treble controls? The book claims you can stack more speakers through the app but I would not invest in that as it continually says my phones Bluetooth is off. lolFine retro look, sturdy, small footprint and working out for podcasts. Do not think the app is or will be helpful.If I were to try another I’d probably go with the Klipsch of similar design. It’s approximately $50 more but better sound and working app.Remove $25 dollars off price on the Em II and it’s a fair deal.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024",AHIQF7PWHKOE36B564CMAEITLRDQ,True,12,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

RVQU04O5Y7EP5,B09XXW54QG,4.0 out of 5 stars Rich sound - with the right music,Brett Williams,4,"What I liked most about this unit was the dual driver system where you can get a more stereo sound than other Bluetooth speakers that are more mono (unless you pair a few together). The battery lasting up to 30 hours is impressive, though I didn't just it more than a few hours and couldn't speak to what real-time is. The top metal multi-directional button is very nice and premium feel......however the textured top/rubber surround makes reading the Volume/Track directions virtually impossible to see - you get used to it, but it would be nice if they were a little more visible.I will say that I'm disappointed in 2024, we're still seeing devices with Bluetooth 5.1, considering that it was released in 2016 and 5.3 has been out since 2021.With the driver's front and back-firing, I found that I got a wider sound by turning the unit sideways so that I was looking at the side of the unit while the drivers fired left and right.I listen to just about anything, and other were songs where the speaker excelled, but then others where it sounded very flat, and it's because of the inconsistency that I returned it. I will say that I liked it much more than the JBL's that I tested against which had almost zero depth comparatively, but for a little more I got something that, while larger, has a better sound presence.I was tempted to keep this as an alternative, but I think over time I would probably get annoyed with some songs sounding flat and others very deep and rich (or course tracks and recording quality matter, but compared to other speakers I tested I didn't see as big of a swing between the same songs).","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",AEZLB3QWTROAPNV3SIQVKNOFDS3Q,True,4,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

R13A8CEV5KJI8M,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars So Cool...,John Farrell,5,"I visited a friend on Florida recently and he's building a new house. We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either ""stacking"" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term. Buy with confidence.","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2024",AFHFRU22UQRFPEVWBHQFXHBHVYWA,True,3,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

This speaker is all you need to sync your music with a clear, superior sound boost. I remember the Marshall amps for my punk rock days. This is a replica of the Marshall amps and that's one of the reasons I chose this speaker. Sound quality has not been sacrificed and it is easy to use. It's all you need. I purchased this a week ago and bought another for my son this week. I will most likely purchase one for my hubby because he is using mine all the time, and yes we have different tastes in music. Look at others if you wish, or save time and get this little powerhouse, Marshall.","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2024",AEAF6N7CEGGH6D4W7EZV3CTY2EIA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Emberton

A serious audiophile would probably want a speaker that allows for more control, but the sound profile suits my needs.I've had very little trouble with the speaker losing its connection. There are only a couple of spots in my apartment (~600 sq ft) where the connection breaks up; fortunately, the connection is solid everywhere else, particularly in those rooms where I mostly want to use it.Build quality feels good and solid, like it's going to hold up for a long time. The speaker did get a light spray of water on it one day when I'd left it on my balcony and it suddenly began to rain, but the speaker was just fine.Of course Marshall has a reputation for quality sound gear, but the price still feels a little high given how simple this is.

There is no ability to toggle any sort of EQ. So the sound you hear, is the sound you get. The thing that I like least about this speaker is the function button.

Then a friend introduced me to the Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker, claiming it's as good or better than his fancy B&O speaker, but less than half the price.Now, when I saw the Marshall speaker's price tag at $128.00, I hesitated. I mean, I've been forking out $250.00 and more for other speakers. But curiosity got the better of me, and boy, am I glad it did!

R36E6CRFVVROEG,B086D4JNGM,5.0 out of 5 stars SRS-XB33 vs Charge 4 (and also a few cheaper models),Allan R,5,"So I've been looking for my do-it-all BT speaker for a while, without spending too much, and of the ones I have owned, the Sony SRS-XB33 is the clear winner. Scroll down if you want to read the direct review of the Sony speaker. Previously, I've owned the Oontz Angle 3 Ultra, and briefly the Tribit Maxsound Plus, and JBL Charge 4. The Oontz speakers I still own, (two in paired stero), and they are a great value for the money, especially as a pair in stereo. That would be a clear winner for me for under $100 (for both!) However, as you might imagine, the small size and overall build prevents this from really producing deep, resonating bass, and the overall sound is a little thin without a ton of range. However, for a lot of people, these would be a perfectly acceptable choice for on-the-go music.The Tribit Maxsound was just not very good. I don't know how it seems to receive such high praise as an affordable, but great sounding speaker. It just isn't very good, very tinny, and the bass is really lacking. The Oontz speakers are a much better sound profile, and even slightly better bass. That model also cannot be paired in stereo (AFAIK). Not worth purchasing IMO.Now, for the XB33, and how it compared to a worthy competitor, the JBL Charge 4. The two speakers are of similar size (I didn't get exact measurements, but are more or less similar), and larger than I might have though. Perhaps because I was used to much smaller, cheaper BT speakers... These are definitely not as portable, at least for things like packing in luggage. Probably fine for road trips, but I would not want to pack this in my airplane luggage. In the box comes the speaker, a charging cord and some (terrible) instructions. The instructions now look like IKEA assembly instructions, just confusing pictures. The pairing process is pretty easy.SOUND: The sound quality of this speaker is outstanding. The overall sound profile is very rich, and it seems to carry farther than the volume would indicate. Meaning, some speakers are loud, but when you walk further away from it, the sound dissipates quickly. The Sony speaker's sound carries farther, I don't know why that is, or how that is quantified, other than when I walk away from it, the volume I hear decreases much more slowly than some other speakers I've had. Again, that's one of those possibly subjective things, but it's definitely true based on my experience. The bass is very robust and resonates well without simply thumping for the sake of being the deepest, hardest bass. The Charge 4 has deeper bass that hits harder, but this one just sounds better. It complements the mids and highs much better than the Charge 4. Speaking of which, the main issue I had with that speaker is the lack of clarity in the mid range. The profile was just too one-dimensional for me. Thumpy bass and decent highs, but there was no depth to the sound. I just could not get into the sound profile from that speaker. You'll see a common complaint about the Charge 4 is the mids, and it absolutely is true. A good speaker with very good bass, but no depth and dimension to it. Back to this speaker, the overall sound profile is the key point. The bass is very good, but the speaker isn't just a slapper. The mids and highs are all excellently rendered in a very three dimensional sound that works well together. There isn't one aspect of this speaker that is ""the best"", but as a total package, it's the best sound I've heard from speakers in and around this price point. Recently I purchased a second to pair in stereo, and I'm even more impressed now. One speaker by itself sounds so rich that you may not need a second, but you really can hear the difference in two of them. Hands down, this is the winner vs the Charge 4, and an excellent value in this price range. Oh, I forgot to mention the lights! They are customizeable in the app, and really add some additional flare to a great sounding speaker, for those big house parties.A few minor complaints I have. One is the volume of this speaker is surprisingly low. I have sensitive hearing, so I generally don't need extreme volume, but I find myself usually at about 80-90% volume outside, and maybe 70% inside, and that's just to listen at a decently loud, but comfortable volume. If you turn it all the way up, it's loud, but I could easily leave it turned up all the way without feeling like my ears would start bleeding immediately. Even my small Oontz speakers can get louder. Again, as a stereo pair, the overall volume is much louder, and that might be a solution, but as a solo speaker, some people might find the volume a bit low. Also, the battery life is pretty poor. Maybe I'm not used to these larger speakers, but I find myself charging the thing every few days, using it several hours a day. It is probably within spec, but it sure does seem like these need to be charged quite often. However, apart from that, this speaker is fantastic, and highly recommended.","Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2020",AE337MXGVFISTCBIEDVVWGUFS2IQ,True,123,Color: Blue

R362ZP81YD83WL,B086D4JNGM,5.0 out of 5 stars Performs as Expected,Dave in VA,5,"Very good sound quality for a small portable speaker. Blue Tooth easily pairs with iPhone, Android, and Amazon Echo. Volume adjusts well in very small increments from very quiet to loud. I have not turned it to full volume yet, so I don't know how loud it can get or how much distortion there may be at full volume, but at reasonable levels, I did not detect any distortion. In a large room, 18'X30', with vaulted ceiling, it was still loud even at just a mid-range volume. I do not use the lighting system in it, I found that useless - I wanted a speaker, not a light show.I have been using the device for almost one month on a regular, almost daily, basis, paired to phones and to an Amazon Echo - far superior sound quality to any of those. Used it once on battery mode for several or more hours at a moderate volume without it going dead or noticing any other issues. When it is in battery mode, it turns off after awhile. Left connected to charging cable, it auto-connects with BT device, no manual switching needed.Took on a vacation, put it in the laptop backpack with two laptops, etc., it's light enough and small enough that weight and size is not an issue.So far I am satisfied with how well it performs. I have another portable speaker I bought about 5 years ago for a similar price that is much smaller. I thought that one was pretty good, this Sony blows that one away. This one also pairs more readily and the sound volume, unlike the last one, can be adjusted in small increments.","Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2021",AGTPLWFF7BBIYTFEPFINH6VCANJA,True,1,Color: Black
RT4S0NBB1JFT6,B086D4JNGM,4.0 out of 5 stars Wow! Very slept on!,G-$,4,"Usually I'd buy personal audio from a manufacturer who specializes in speakers, like JBL, Beats by Dre or Sennheiser. But after purchasing some XB50AP earbuds, listening to some XB950N1 headphones, as well as my hearing my brother's SRS-XB31 Bluetooth speaker, I figured there was something to this XB (XTRA BASS) thing that Sony has. The SRS-XB33 is no exception! I bought this speaker to replace a JBL Flip 4 that I gave to my brother's girlfriend. Like all the XTRA BASS devices, the sound is crisp and clean with deep bass. I think It could have been louder. The party lights could have been better visually. And I wish the buttons on the control panel & the access panel in the back were illuminated for easier use. This speaker plays bigger than it looks. The party lights are... well I've seen better. But you'll get more playing time with them OFF. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW -- There's no AUX input. The speaker ships with the party lights & XTRA BASS ON. You can turn them OFF from the speaker, but there's very few audio or illumination settings otherwise. For those reasons, I recommend installing the Sony Music Center app on your Apple or Android device. It's very easy to use and offers multiple illumination settings, as well as additional audio settings; to include an equalizer. For additional party settings, also install Sony Fiestable. It automatically integrates with the Music Center app, but works indepently for other party functions. The speaker uses a USB Type C Charger, (in the packaging, no plug) and It has Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity. U could even connect via NFC. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase! It has pretty good tech & great sound.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2021",AHPEAYDD3GXEYQWAQT5VWMLSVMQA,True,3,Color: Black

It is not as loud as jbl speakers in its price range but it is loud enough to be heard several feet away outside. I work outside in urban community gardens and there is a lot of noises competing on being the loudest.My usual work day is shoveling stuff and so sound of several shovels scraping can be pretty loud. I keep the xb33 at 100% and the music is not drowned out by outdoor sounds. The speaker last about 8-10 hours at full volume on live mode or extra bass mode. Stamina mode can last 24 hours but it feels pointless to drop that much on a speaker and not use it's full potential.One of my coworkers has a jbl charge 5 but everyone prefers my xb33 despite it not being as loud. The xb33 makes up for its lack of loudness by having a much better balanced sound stage. You can hear every instrument and detail clearly and it doesn't get lost when you turn up the volume. The jbl speakers aeem to only focua on vocals,, mids, highs, and booming bass. The same songs can sound noticeably different on each speaker.Regarding music, this speaker is versatile. I use it to play trip hop, hip hop, drum & bass, jpop, rock, metal, soul, funk, dub, Latin jazz, orchestral, house and pop music and it all sounds great on it. The speaker doesn't have bias for any genre or elements but with the equalizer app you can get some customization. I have a video showing off the different songs I have playing on it.The range is fantastic and lives up to marketing. I had coworkers pair to my speaker and the walk offsite to do something else. Their phone would still be playing music through the speaker after they left but once they left the 66 feet range then it would disconnect.It lives up to being waterproof I used it in the rain and it worked perfectly fine. I spilt soda on it and ran water on it and it wasn't damaged at all either. I never worry about getting the speaker dirty because I know I can rinse the dirt off.I bought mine used for $60 and was surprised by how new it looks and perform.

REH36D64QXBG5,B086D4JNGM,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound for the shower or a tiny room, annoying song control buttons, 4 hour battery life",Ariel Fisher,4,"ITEM REVIEWED: SONY SRSXB33I like pop and rock music and I am an audiophile who buys high end speakers, amps, and subwoofers.This speaker sounds AWESOME in a very small space, such as an enclosed shower. Even all by itself, just a single channel I enjoy listening to it almost as much as a much larger powerful system.Unfortunate drawbacks though. By far the worst drawback is the terribly annoying song control buttonsThere SHOULD be a separate button for PAUSE, NEXT SONG, and GO BACK A SONG. Instead all 3 are the same button. Press once to pause, twice fast to go forward, thrice fast to go back. Insanely annoying.Very often you try to SKIP THE SONG and instead pause and unpause. Drawback #2: Only runs a bit over 4 hours at max volume, and WORSE YET announces audibly PLEASE RECHARGE with at least an hour left.Drawback #3: Only powerful enough for a very small space such as an enclosed shower. You will need way more than ONE of these for larger rooms. Worth it if all you need is a shower speaker and don't mind the annoying song controls. Nice to be able to answer phone calls in the shower:).Took off a full star due to the insane lack of proper song control buttons.Update 3/4/22:Comparison to the OONTZ ANGLE 3 ULTRA (2 tone BLUE COLOR):The Sony has a bit more bass feel to it, but bear in mind that the SONY is about 4 times the size and weight of the OONTZ and more than double the price. Unless you care about the gimmicky lights (yes they are cool) in the SONY, the OONTZ is far superior simply because of the song control buttons which are 3 separate buttons on the OONTZ, rather than one button and a song and dance about how many times to press it on the SONY. The OONTZ also pairs more reliably and easily to the bluetooth host than does the SONY. Overall max volume and music quality is almost identical on the 2 except the bass is fuller on the SONY due to its greater heft. Battery life is FAR SUPERIOR on the OONTZ - lasting at least 12 hours at MAX vs. 4 on the SONY.","Reviewed in the United States February 18, 2022",AGAIJRXU7OM7GW45NHJPLLVW2XPA,True,5,Color: Blue

R3P4QT9D0W8PQQ,B086D4JNGM,3.0 out of 5 stars Not What I Anticipated,Charles Chaffee,3,"When I bought this I perhaps didn’t do enough research. I bought it for the purpose of the cross country backpacking trip I am considering undertaking. That being said, there’s nothing particularly horrible about the speaker per se; but for my purpose it seems highly impractical.First, while the lights (as pictured above) and corresponding apps you can download are neat little gimmicks when sitting in your living room, etc. they are not something that I feel are a true selling point. I am most concerned with sound quality and battery capacity. Secondly, it seems quite a bit larger than seemingly necessary for the sound it produces… I also have a JBL Charge 4 that I’ve had for going on 2 years now. It is not only smaller but packs a bigger “punch” (and by “punch” I am not meaning to say the JBL has better sound quality; just that it hits harder from a smaller unit).As far as sound quality goes, this Sony XB33 (maybe I should have spent $100 more on the 43) does nothing to really blow me away. It doesn’t sound bad whatsoever, and the clarity is really good. The sound seems to carry better than the JBL, and the clarity as far as distinguishing between different aspects of the song is definitely better. But it does nothing to blow me away. Again: it’s a $149 (or whatever it costed) speaker and it is far worth that as far as sound quality goes.The battery life seems pretty good as well, though not so sure it surpasses the Charge 4… I’m sure there are settings that can be adjusted (no lights, bass boost off, etc) that will prolong that. I have not had it long enough to experiment with that yet however.One neat feature I found was the little three channel (Low, Mid, High) equalizer that can be found in the app. It is an ice touch.One thing I don’t like is the completely un-rugged feel of this thing. No doubt it’s fine for the house and backyard, deck, etc… but I won’t be taking it on a 1000 mile backpacking trip.Reading over everything I wrote here I realize it seems as though I’m dissing this thing. That was not the intention. It sounds good. It is a great price. It has some nice (albeit I feel unnecessary) features. It seems a bit bulky and doesn’t feel quite rugged enough for my personal taste.

ROP40ONFLIY5M,B086D4JNGM,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent sound, easy pairing with buttons, but no aux input",Jason Dunn,4,"I'm pretty picky about my Bluetooth speakers, and normally go for Anker products, but when I saw The Wirecutter rate the Sony SRS-XB33 speaker so highly I figured I'd give it a try.Long story short, I was so impressed with the first one I bought, I purchased a second one so I could put them in ""party mode"" and use two at the same time. The sound is excellent: full, rich, and a decent amount of bass for something this small. The software app is pretty rough, and it has a frustrating limitation of not remembering the speaker pairing. It does allow you to control the lights on the speakers, which is a nice touch. I discovered that using the buttons on the back are a much easier way of creating the speaker pairing, so I do that each time - I wish it would just remember the setup like my older, cheaper VAVA speakers do.My one knock against this product is the lack of an AUX input. There are situations where having an AUX input is really handy - like when I want to take the audio from my Nintendo Switch and put it out to the speakers. I got around that by using a Bluetooth audio transmitter from the Switch, but the audio levels are lower so it's not ideal. This would be a 5-star product if it has an AUX input.Overall this is a great product, and I love that Sony offers this speaker in bold, beautiful colours - I went with the red, and it's awesome looking!","Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2020",AG4TNMGWFXUNI5TZANSMQHPYOXEA,True,21,Color: Red
RU9MWWHIOY9UT,B086D4JNGM,3.0 out of 5 stars Sony vs JBL - Not terrible but Not great,Amazon Customer,3,"I purchased this speaker in December of ‘21 and have genuinely been waiting to give it a review to see how I actually like it. Unfortunately, I’m less than impressed with this speaker. The speaker does have a decent sound - as in the speaker works. However, I don’t feel like I can figure out the right sound settings. It’s either too much bass and not enough voice or too much voice and no bass. This speaker also has a very forward sound. If you are standing to the side or back of the speaker you can hardly hear the sound. I used to have a JBL and switched to Sony. The JBL has a very 360 sound where you can set the speaker anywhere and hear it everywhere. With the Sony I’m constantly having to move the speaker with me so I can hear the sound. The Sony Music Center app you use to adjust the effects is also kind of odd and pointless. The speaker itself doesn’t have a great sound like the JBL does so it’s hard to pinpoint what settings you need to make it sound better. There’s also a ‘Live’ button on the speaker itself that Sony touts should fill a room more with sound and be a more ‘live concert’ feel. I unfortunately don’t hear much difference at all between Live on and Live off. Overall, I should have stuck with my gut and JBL instead of switching. Again, in my opinion? not a terrible speaker but also not great.","Reviewed in the United States October 3, 2022",AHOKBZV2EYHME4H436RMEI2S7DKA,True,6,Color: Black

R189XI8M77ZQQB,B086D4JNGM,"2.0 out of 5 stars it does the job, but there are way better speakers out there.",sophia,2,"(I got the sony srs-xb33) It’s a fine speaker, if you don’t mind or really note differences in sound quality, but even then you could find other speaker at a similar price that sounds better and is louder- loll. I saw many comments saying the volume is relatively low and now that I have it and used it, I understand what they meant and it’s true. From the first time I used it like two days ago I was like oh wow, it is low… If you’re just using it to listen to some music while you’re home it’s definitely loud enough. But again, for the size and price you can find something better. It produces a low volume even when it’s loud. I wanted to test this out so I compared it to another speaker I have (same song and approx same volume). The other speaker was noticeably louder. I even raised the volume more on the sony, and STILL my other speaker was louder. Not only that but the other speaker had amazing sound quality. Before doing this comparison today to test the “loudness,” I already noted that the sound quality wasn’t all that great. Even if you mess with the EQ the sony music center app, it doesn’t help all that much. The sound just isn’t crisp and rich. It was easy to connect, and the bluetooth worked out nicely. The range was good too, it still worked fine as I left my phone in one spot of the house and took the speaker with me in other rooms. If you want a speaker just to have around the house, it’ll be fine, it’s not horrible but honestly, it’s not that great of a speaker. I’d recommend looking for another one. Also, this may be a bit random but I really didn’t like how tiny the cable is, that was the first thing I didn’t like when I opened it for the first time lol. It’s like 21 inches. A small cable is fine for other products but it’s a bit inconvenient to have such a small cable for the portable speaker. I only charged it when I got it as instructed on the pamphlet that shows you how to connect to the speaker. The battery is still high and I’ve used it a bit in the past two days. I feel like you’ll run into the same things if you get the srs-xb43, it’s just bigger really. I saw reviews on the xb43 that mentioned the things I’m experiencing on the xb33.","Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2022",AHQZCP4QY7KLE7XYPPZRYSMAEU7A,True,1,Color: Black

I researched LDAC vs aptX codecs and given the LDAC high bandwidth and the overall good reviews of this speaker, thought this was the best choice.After receiving the speakers I paired the first one with my phone and saw in both the phone settings (including the developer options) and the Sony Music Center app, that LDAC/HD audio was being used. However, when I stereo paired the second speaker, LDAC went dead and the connection protocol switched to SBC (the base codec for Bluetooth connectivity). I checked all the settings and all the HD options on the phone were greyed out. I searched the web and Sony literature for answers. Why advertise LDAC and its increased bandwidth if it can only be used on a mono speaker? Also, Sony's Bluetooth headphones maintain stereo sound while in LDAC, so what's the difference? I never did find out. I was finally able to chat with a Sony rep and they confirmed that LDAC is not available in stereo mode. Makes no sense to me that it is what it is.If you're looking for great stereo sound from two of these, forget it. Instead, you need to look for a pair that has aptX HD, LL or adaptive capabilities.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2022",AGPKMQBQTEEASFQ47DWKL2YMFFUQ,True,0,Color: Black

I also am a sucker for flashing lights that dance to the music which this does. When I saw the product labeled as ""extra bass"" I was wary, but I wanted to try anyway. It does boast a full sound (a nice live sound). But when you turn it up full volume on your phone/device and on the speaker, the speaker starts to sound garbled and static-y. When I see a product labeled extra bass I want to be embrassed to play it in my apartment complex. I want my floors to shake. I want someone knocking on my door. I recommend if you want that experience go for the Harmon/Kardon speaker as it seems to be better designed for this. The main reason I kept it was the portability and size of it.

The battery life depends on how loud you play it, but will last plenty long enough for a day's worth of activities.

My kids also like to stream music while splashing around in the pool also. They don't throw the speaker in the pool but it's suppose to be water proof. I don't use the lighting effects much but it would be a great party attention getter with a multiple speaker set up. The sound is good, but not amazing. I paid $129 for it and I feel it sounds great for that price point. My only gripe is that I wish it got a little louder....maybe 15-20% louder for my outdoor purposes. It's plenty loud for indoor use.","Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2020",AE6XLMRGB2ZLNXZ2JOWREGG2SVRQ,True,4,Color: Blue
R2PGKDAKP3QFSX,B086D4JNGM,5.0 out of 5 stars great little speaker,Bobby Erwin,5,"So far, very pleased with this speaker. The sound is great. Overall, Sony tends to weight the sound of their speakers towards bass; but the Sony app allows me to tweak the EQ to my liking right from my phone.I've used it for podcasts, for music, so far only around the house. It's more than adequate to fill a room with sound, so it's definitely meeting my needs.I play guitar, and I've used it as the 'band' backing track for practice sessions. Perfect for that. It's plenty loud to keep up with my amp at 'home' volumes. Again, it's bass / mid heavy, so I had to goose the treble quite a bit for the symbols to cut enough over the mids from my amp. A more balanced sound is better for that application.","Reviewed in the United States October 6, 2020",AFWKO2KUWJVWLUO34FIRXBPWPO6A,True,1,Color: Black

But I used it almost every day and frequently took it in the car with me where it rolled around in the seat sometime but it never really took a bad beating. Over the last few months I noticed a “buzz” from the bass on some songs. If it were possible to easily service this Sony speaker then it would be a 4 or even a 5 star product, but since no one seems to know how to fix it I’m downgrading to 3 stars for now.Previous review:I’ve had mine for about 18 months and the battery drains and dies a lot faster than it used to.I wouldn’t mind much if it were easy to replace the battery since it’s a solid speaker otherwise:I still enjoy using it just about every day.","Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2022",AFSR43AFFQIB6TBAP6GFLDFPJ5DQ,True,0,Color: Blue

R3F1RORIXCBEKD,B086D4JNGM,2.0 out of 5 stars Not worth the price,Jason,2,Purchased XB33 a couple of weeks ago. Unit looks nice and the lights are pretty cool. Download the app for better EQ controls. Overall the sound quality is just ok. I purchased this as several reviewers stated it had great sound quality and bass. Obviously I understand this is a small Bluetooth speaker and do not expect it to sound like the 2 12” subs in my car. However I did expect a little bit of bass tones based on the design and weight of the speaker. Any song with actual bass will distort the sound quality severely almost to the point it sounds like its blowing the speakers out even when only turned half way up. Battery life isn’t the best either. This unit usually lasts a couple of hours while riding around on the golf cart listening to it. The longest it has lasted me on a full charge is about 4-5 hours so definitely not something you want to purchase and try to use outdoors without a power supply for extended periods of time. For the price and quality I would not recommend this product. I have a JBL Clip 3 that weighs less than a third of the xb33 and honestly out performs it in just about everyway from sounds quality to battery life.

Some of the comments about lack of base are baseless :-) This is a small speaker & can't be expected to deliver base like a large sound system. The same thought on comments about it not being loud enough are also inaccurate. I've yet to crank it up past about the halfway point for fear of bothering the neighbors. Now granted it's not loud enough to fill an auditorium or outside concert venue, but then that's not what you buy it for. Some will love the flashing lights, others such as myself might see them as a small distraction.

However it is nowhere near loud enough for my intended use. At full volume with my phone set to its max, the speaker just fills a 12x10 interior room. Since the intent is to use on a PWC where it will need to overcome engine noise, I have no confidence in it being loud enough. I suspected this would be the case when Sony refused to discuss specifications such as SPL or wattage and compare it to the competition. Sadly I waited well over a week for delivery as Amazon has had trouble getting stock of this new unit. Also, the NFC feature didn't work with my Samsung phone. Not a big deal as BT pairing is pretty easy.Now due to Sony's over-selling the XB33's abilities, Amazon will be getting a return of a nice product and incurreng shipping both ways, but that's the beauty of Prime...","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2020",AFKRXRA4E2X2CDCX7OQZX24ABATA,True,63,Color: Blue

Charge lasts for quite a while. I use it off and on so don't know how long for continual use. I guess the only thing I didn't like was that the USB C-type charge cord was only a foot long so a little impractical. But easy enough to pick up a longer cord.

It's a little big, and kinda heavy, but the built in handle makes transport a breeze - and it lays flat when not in use. The speaker is very well designed, and looks great. It gets fairly loud, but nothing too crazy. The JBLs definitely get louder, but I like the sound quality of the Sony better. At low to mid volumes, you can get over 12 hours of constant playing from the speaker. At near full volume, it's more like 6-8.

First make sure the LDAC is engaged and I also found the live setting to get more clarity and sparkle than the megebass setting and last but not least use a third party music app (I recommend Musicolet) it has multiple EQ band settings and also preamp to boost the volume of your music.With these 3 factors addressed this speaker produces some of the most well-balanced sound of all my Bluetooth speakers especially for its size, just like a fine instrument, it has to be tuned to get the best sound quality from it!!","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2024",AEBN67HUWEPFLVQN4KCYKDGAWVRQ,True,8,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRSXG300/H

(Bow Hunting Skills, Numchuck skills, you know the rest....)",Natascha,5,"+The sound is amazing,+the battery life seems to last forever (especially if you turn off lights and bass boost, but even leaving them on...I'm still so impressed)+It looks super nice. I use this primarily as a home speaker actually that I move around at times, and I think it's a great speaker serving that role, too. I find it impressive truly as an ALL IN ONE product, you know? I must say, even after reviews, this speaker is better experienced in person than the reviews can even show. It's truly impressive. I think when asking if you should buy this or not, the answer is definitely YES if you want the extra features. For example,++ being able to turn this into a guitar amp is gonna make me feel especially cool when I very poorly sing and play guitar. I don't know how often I'll use this, but to have that as an option as actually pretty freaking sweet.++ Being able to charge things from my speaker, even if pretty slowly, is cool and useful.++ Being able to plug in an amazon echo into this speaker and have Alexa voice activated assistance is also freaking sweet. Having such a long battery life is a convenience even just using this mostly as a home speaker.This speaker really does rock! ;) It has numchuck skills, bow hunting skills, it just has skillz. It's NOICE!(I hope this review helps someone in some way. Remember to embrace your inner Napoleon.)which one, you say?You decide!Do you want this even at all AND you have the money? If so, go for it! If you want to spend less and don't mind lacking a few features, (features lik a guitar amp plug, an aux plug, two usb a charging ports, and a super long battery life), consider other options like the Soundcore Motion Boom Plus. You can spend half the price and get something that sounds really, really good still if just having something that plays good sounding music is your primary concern. It will lack some features, but they may be things you wouldn't really prioritize or use often anyway on a more feautre ridden speaker. Being poor, sometimes spending more really pays off, but it doesn't always. Sometimes I'm just as satisfied with a product at a lower price that still has 98% of the other features in common with higher priced items. Does paying more pay off here?

That being said, I do love having a large portable speaker that I can put in any room of the house and fill it with music or whatever. It's a bit heavy at 5 pounds and should definitely have had a better base for stability because I'm not sure how well it would survive a fall. It also doesn't seem to ever power off despite the settings I chose for that very reason. That being said, the battery life is ridiculously long and I can leave it on all day without any issues.

In my house, we own every JBL Bluetooth speaker (Clip, Flip, Charge, Extreme, Boombox, etc…and the different versions of them), we also have multiple UE speakers (Wonderboom, Boom, and MegaBoom), multiple Sonos speakers (Arc, Mini Sub, One SL, etc.), and one Bose speaker (it’s older, I forget what). Needless to say, I have a lot personal experience with these devices.In my opinion, this Sony SRS-XG300 is about as good as the JBL Charge 3 or 4 (not 5). I was actually surprised at how bad the low end sound is for this speaker considering its size, the bass is just not there no matter how you try and tune it. Using the Mega Bass button is almost laughable because all it does is add bass, without it, there’s virtually zero bass. The speaker is not room filling at all and can even sound kind of “tinny” during certain sounds with higher pitches. It might be great in a lab with specific sound measuring equipment, but in a real world setting, it doesn’t sound any better than a medium mid-level speaker that’s half its size.I paid $148 when it was on sale and would say that’s about the most I would ever pay for it…but honestly I would just avoid it altogether because even if you got it cheap, you’ll be disappointed once you use it. Go with a JBL Extreme or UE MegaBoom (if you want that larger size speaker), you will be much happier with your purchase. The JBL Boombox is my favorite Bluetooth speaker by far, but it’s stupid expensive and way overkill for most people.","Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2024",AGNGXFTNXGOGLV6JO4MVPOM5CUUQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG300/B

Whether you're enjoying your tunes or cranking up the volume for a dance party, this speaker is guaranteed to impress. The bass is deep and punchy, adding that extra kick to your music.One aspect that really stood out to me is its portability. Despite its powerful sound output, this speaker is surprisingly compact and lightweight. You can effortlessly carry it with you wherever you go, be it a picnic or a fun beach gathering. Moreover, with its IP67 rating, it's designed to withstand dust and water, making it ideal for all kinds of escapades.Connecting to this speaker couldn't be easier thanks to its Bluetooth functionality. Pairing it with my phone was a breeze, and I experienced no issues with the connection throughout my usage. Furthermore, the speaker offers a range that grants me freedom of movement without any concerns about losing connectivity.Battery life is always a concern when using speakers; however, the Sony SRS-XG300 has got you covered in that department. With a 24-hour battery life, you can enjoy music all day and night without needing to worry about recharging. It even comes with a USB port, allowing you to conveniently charge your devices while on the move.Finally, the design is sleek and contemporary. It's evident that Sony has meticulously considered every aspect, from the construction to the user controls.

R2LKEYDZ9Q0Z57,B0B43Y8GHZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Buy for outdoor needs,KnightFox,5,I switched to this speaker after using the waterproof JBL speaker. Here are the reasons why this was the right decision even though this speaker cost a little more.1. Battery life. I use this speaker 4 times a week for at least 5 hours and I only charge it once a month.2. Waterproof. I take this speaker on a small sailboat during regatta racing. It got not just wet but submerged in salt water few times when a wave washes through the cockpit. It still runs without issues. Afterwards a give it a rinse with fresh water garden hose.3. Sound levels. It has a great sound and packs a punch. The bass is strong. The treble could be clearer.4. It does have an auxiliary input even though it doesn’t specifically say that in the descriptions on amazon. Bluetooth works great too and is easy to connect.5. It is larger than the jbl speaker and heavier too but that is to be expected if my other points matter to you too.6. Dont buy the case that gets suggested with the product. The grip is too flimsy for the weight of the speaker. Better you get that carry strap that can snap on.,"Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2023",AEGU5Q7IAD6FC2LGLCE4D2GZBBTQ,True,9,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRSXG300/H

When the opportunity presented itself to buy this unit for under $200, it was an absolute no-brainer. It plays loud. Crystal clear loud with a deep punchy bass to boot! And the battery? Well, we had this speaker at a at rendezvous of a motley lot of characters deep within the twigs of the Nicolet National Forest in northern Wisconsin where it was playing at minimum 12-hours straight with plenty to go and only plugged in on a recharge simply because we were not using it. I haven't tested out the guitar plug-in, as of yet. So I cannot report on that aspect. But the lights are cool especially during nightfall if you're into that sort of thing. Oh, and this unit is certifibly solid. It can literally be dragged through a swamp during monsoon season and it won't miss a beat or soak up a molecule of moisture with its superior water tight design. is great when your spending the weekend in camp or at the beach when a sudden downpour shows up on an otherwise sunny day!

The general use is that it's our garage speaker, the kids use it when playing hoops and sauce toss. I also occasionally take it to the patio. Overall I think it has a much better sound than what it replaced with much heavier bass, in fact it could be a little too much for my taste with some music. The sound profiles help to adjust as needed. My expectations on these were pretty low given they are small battery powered speakers but I am impressed with what it produces. I did find the battery life seems to be just ok. We are charging it more than the old speaker but it could also be that the kids are playing it louder.

It came with the cords and instruction manual BUT the speaker itself had no factory stickers or protective film. I found it odd because everyone knows upon purchasing new products - there is usually SOMETHING (such as a sticker and/or protective film) giving the purchaser some type of assurance that they just bought a BRAND NEW product. But I just tried brushing it off and plugged that baby in. I charged it and played a couple songs but that was it. It was late and so it wasn't until New Year's Eve that I had actually tried out the volume level and ""MEGA BASS"" feature and I noticed the second time I actually powered it on that there was definite distortion or static. My friend who was over noticed it as well. So after playing detective and after watching multiple un-boxing videos of the SONY SRS-XG500 I noticed they all came fresh up outta the box with two blue stickers located on the front of the speaker. MINE HAD NOTHING.I called SONY and they confirmed that it most definitely should have had the new stickers attached. They had me to two different reset features in hopes to fix the sound trouble - but to no avail.They (SONY) is sending me a pre-paid shipping label and sending me a NEW SONY SRS-XG500 from the actual warehouse.

REPT12N1Z65B,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars Tribit Stormbox Blast,BLRG,5,"Arrived yesterday and connected it straight away. Had 60% charge on arrival and excellent packaging. Sound blows away the Soundcore Motion Boom + (in my opinion) which I tried first but was just not able to get the deeper bass and despite watching all the videos and reviews and eq recommendations was not able to get the deep bass or anything close to the Tribit also was not able to reduce the screechy highs on the MB+. My son has the HK Onyx studio 6 and when comparing the MB+ to the studio 6 the only area the MB+ wins is it gets louder but the sound is no where near the shear richness or quality of the Studio 6. This Tribit has the deep bass and smooth richness but can also get loud and also sounds great on lower volumes as well - normally listen at 30%-40%. We are using it as a sound bar for our TV right now and watched a couple movies last night. WOW what a difference. Was like being at the cinema - the rumble on the lows! The bluetooth is easy to connect and only small issue is delay when flipping between tv, phone & laptop bluetooth. Was flipping between multiple devices simultaneously, Was testing with youtube videos from the laptop, movies on TV and music from my phone as well as playing with the tribit app & settings. I think it is only supposed to connect to two devices at a time but irrespective it was only slight delay flipping between 3 devices - between 2-3 seconds. The sound and deep bass is so good for its size and I know many talk of it being heavy but its not heavy to me, feels right and solid - not cheap -but quality. It is super easy to carry around and will be great for the boat / lake and beach. It is warm and rich sounding with plenty of customization. Will see how the battery does over time and how it keeps performing but so far very impressed. Started the morning with the battery at 100% and shows on the app. As soon as the light on the unit showed it was filly charged the app said 100%. Lights on it are bright- nice to have but I keep them turned off. Nice thing is they still show when adjusting the volume even when light display is off. Have had it on today non-stop for 12 hours so far playing between 40 - 60% volume - lights off - working as a TV sound bar and for streaming music. I am still showing 60%.

RZN1X5HHIPU79,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars Unbeatable price/performance! Has 3.5 mm aux input!,Corndog,5,"Sure, it's a bit weighty, but I'd rather that and have nice, beefy sound, than to have it be light and have a less substantial sound. But you may differ. If you are one of those people, you may prefer the Motion Boom Plus by Soundcore. I got a chance to test out both in person, and personally, like many, I went with the Blast.The Motion Boom Plus can be tuned for an elegant sound, but its limited EQ in the app kills what could be much better. I was able to get richer, lower reaching bass out of it using a 3rd party app, but it took much work what was existent out off the box with the Blast - and much more substantial at that! The retro-looking RGB side lights are icing on the cake. Very cool to look at, and adds a unique effect.As for sound, I usually opt for flat, neutral tunes when it comes to my monitors and headphones, but I wanted a fun, boomy ""travel"" speaker (more like 'road-trip speaker) that was competent with the bass. Not only is it clean and punchy, it can reach down surprisingly low for such small drivers. The mids and highs are nothing to write home about, but they aren't terrible. They're serviceable. Mids are a bit recessed, dry, and resist drastic tuning, but can be slightly brightened to bring the tracks alive. Could be better, but not bad, and doesn't ruin the sound of the speaker. I'll also add here that I wouldn't have purchased this speaker if it did not have the 3.5 mm aux input, so good on Tribit for including that.Battery life is also phenomenal, but prepare to lose just a tiny bit in the power of the sound when unplugged. I honestly prefer that approach, as I value sound quality over portability. If it's relatively close while on battery, but gets a nice boost plugged in, hooray for that! In the end, I suppose it's how you look at it; lose power when unplugged for portability vs get a boost when plugged in - I see it the second way because I'm used to the philosophy that there is always a sacrifice for portability.Right now the Stormbox Blast is priced 40% off its original price at $155.98. That's awesome, especially when you consider that the less capable, yet lighter Motion Boom Plus is price $5 more. It's really going to come down to your preferences and personal needs. But if it's for a more powerful sound, a flashier look and presence, then this one is going to be it in this price range.","Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2023",AHFFS52VKVXLX27S2JJMXWFDQ5AA,True,55,
RWUVNJD6SC9JC,B09PMYTJD2,4.0 out of 5 stars Great initial quality,SuperBlindGirl,4,"Writing this review from one blind person's perspective.I have purchased other Tribit speakers, namely the storm box. I was very happy with it, so when I wanted some thing bigger and louder for outdoors, I gravitated toward this blast. Based on my experience with the storm box, which is a smaller less powerful speaker, I was hoping the blast would afford the same features. There were some similarities, but some drawbacks as well. It is not a larger version of the storm box. It does have somewhat of a similar feel, same shape only larger, but sports a handle on the top as it is much heavier than I would have expected. I assume this is due to the significantly larger battery which allows for long playtime, lighting, and the ability to charge other devices from the speaker. Well it is noticeably heavy, it is not overwhelmingly heavy. Unlike the storm box, do not expect 360° sound from this speaker. It only projects forward. What I liked about the storm box were large easy to find volume and play pause buttons. The buttons to control the speaker are on the top in front of the handle in a row. While they do have some tactile markings, they are not as pronounced as the storm box, and are much smaller buttons. They can easily blend together. I would have liked to see bigger and better marked buttons considering the large size of this speaker. Similarly to the storm box, the controls only allow for volume up and down and play pause. There are not controls to skip tracks or fast forward. I really would like to see this feature added to their line of products as it would be extremely helpful, so is one drawback to the brand. One cool thing is that you can download the Tribit app, which I did on my iPhone, and this allows for full control of the speaker, including lights, equalizer, and volume controls. I have been using the speaker outside, and I think that is where it excels. It definitely sounds good inside, but definitely seems made for the outdoors. I appreciate that it is water resistant, and it has decently deep base which I also appreciate. The lighting has two different modes, which with my extremely low vision I can barely make out but I'm sure keep things interesting for those who can see. You can control the lights either from the app or using the button on the speaker itself. You can also turn on and off the base boost on the speaker itself or in the app. There are more equalizer options within the app . I don't have much of a very discerning ear I guess, because I have a hard time distinguishing between the difference of bass boost and party modes, but the sound quality is good. The biggest and best surprise for me was that when I used Bluetooth to connect this speaker to my iPhone to play music, the music played on the speaker, but voiceover was only coming out of my phone. I actually love this because it allows me to control the music from my phone accessibly but not interrupt the music. I wish every speaker would do this! my storm box speakers don't seem to have this functionality and I have not experienced it with any other brands of speakers. This made me very happy! I was able to purchase the speaker on sale, which made the price tag a lot more palatable. So my recommendation would be to watch for that! it is definitely overall a solid speaker and worth checking out, especially if you have vision issues.","Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2024",AFIUWEUUEJPYZ2Z6F3WRP6TBHVOA,True,1,

R2BIG9HUD363LX,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars outstanding sound quality,damon,5,"I really appreciate the reviews I came across that recommended this - they were absolutely spot on! I have several different portable/ bluetooth speakers to compare this to, new and older - and it is very impressive. Originally I was trying to replace an older Altec Lansing speaker that the speakers finally gave up, and my wife was looking to upgrade from a little Oontz Angle 3. After looking into the different options, we ended up trying/ getting a few (all of which exceeded the old Altec and the tiny Angle 3).The Bugani Shock is smaller, lighter & much cheaper than the Tribit - it sounds good for its size, can get pretty loud and stays clear, but its not in the same league by a large margin. I had tried the W-King D-10 - its bigger than the Bugani, but smaller & lighter than the Tribit - and priced in the middle of them as well. Again, it sounds good, gets loud, stays clear, had much more bass and had a bigger overall sound stage than the Bugani - but still not on the same scale as this Tribit. I recently got the Klipsch Groove XXL - and sound quality wise, they are extremely close - maybe the Klipsch having a little more detail, the Tribit has a bit more bass - but both have unreal scale, especially for being relatively small, portable speakers. How much bass the Tribit puts out is really impressive for its size - all while having a very balanced overall sound.I havent found out the limit of the battery life yet - but I have played it at around 60-80% volume for several hours continuously w/ no problems.We ended up getting a 2nd Tribit recently when they were on sale - I tried them together in stereo - they work seamlessly and sounds that much better.I could easily give a recommendation for either the Tribit or Klipsch - they're similar size, the Tribit is a little heavier but has a better handle... Finding each on sale - the Tribit is around $20 cheaper... The Klipsch has a remote... I couldnt find any waterproof/ resistance rating for the Klipsch, while the Tribit is IPX7 rated, etc.... I dont believe a better option is available at this time for a speaker under $200 - I did my best to find it.","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2024",AEJ7MGTSJ6ICFUTZIAMMCNLF7USA,True,3,
R1AYDTW2QVE2T,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars Unbelievable Deal!,Chad Czternastek,5,"The media could not be loaded. I budgeted $210 to buy this in a month or two. I seen it on Amazon for $150 and I jumped on the deal. My friend has one so I heard the sound that comes from the speakers. The sub-woofers are built into the flanking sides. It hurts to touch it when you got bass going on.The sound that comes out the speakers is so good. So crisp, so clean, just as good as a Bose if not better. Unless you are one of those who want the expensive, hi-fidelity stuff, these will more than do.Some people complain about the weight but I think it builds into a big space of speakers into a dense set of small speakers combining into 90W. It weighs 12 pounds which don't seem like a lot but you initially expect it to be lighter, and you instantly realize all the weight is the dense design. Only issue I could complain about, if I had to find one, is the battery life. The ads and descriptions say it has so many hours, and they figure that time at super low settings. When you use this at the ideal volume, you are not going to get as much as you think. As I said, if I had to complain it would be that. For me, I listen to music on it, and lasts me two to three days. That's a couple hours, a few there. But if you have it plugged in, you have no worries. 8-10 hours total I would say is realistic.If you get this and like to listen to remastered music, which seems to be the accepted way to cash in on a already successful record. You can tell cause the music quality is top tier. You hear the little things that you don't normally hear. I think listening to the sound, you need to use the pre-set equalizer settings based on the music type. I have no clue on how to use an equalizer but using the pre-set ones you can tell when switching.What makes this so great is how music is bought now compared to a decade and beyond. Used to be you hear a couple songs off an album, you go pay $20 for the record. Now, you pay $10 to Amazon Music or Spotify and you have almost full access to any album, ever. You can discover new music on this. The quality is good enough to invest more time into the great art of music. I've read you can have more then one connected at the same time.Best value of anything I ever got. This is so worth it at retail price but you can usually catch it for $199 or less if you look or find the right deal. I've had a set of speakers well over $500 total that don't sound as good as this. If you are thinking about investing in some speakers, and stream from Bluetooth, I can save you time. Of course if you are looking to get very high quality speakers, and higher level of wattage and thump, you are gonna pay more but this does the job.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2024",AFZDMTNFX6AMFWXYZTFNRWAB34WA,True,8,
RJFFRUZIKDIQP,B09PMYTJD2,"5.0 out of 5 stars Full, LOUD Sound Even in Open Spaces",Teknogk,5,"I have been eying up the JBL BOOMBOX 3 for a while since I love my Charge 4 but I wanted something that filled the yard with sound and carried good bass. The Boombox 3 seemed to be the ticket but man, that price is high.I stumbled onto a review for this Tribit StormBox on YouTube from German guy who had these two side by side on an open basketball court while his son was zooming around a few RC cars. He switched between these two testing the volume, bass, using different music and the difference was remarkable. Unfortunately that video has disappeared but I was impressed enough to look into this and give it a try and when I saw this had a $40 coupon bringing it to $160 I jumped. I was not disappointed!The sound is great, the battery is phenomenal (without running the LEDs and at about 50-75% volume), and a few people who have heard it were very impressed. I had three long 6-8 hours days in the yard and each night forgot to take it in when I only had one and charge it and on the 4th day I thought I might be in trouble lasting all day but checked the app and it still had 40% charge!I loved it so much I purchased a second one so I could run them in stereo mode as a left and right speaker! It also works in 'serial' mode so both speakers are connected and both playing the same music in stereo if they are spread apart too far to have a left and right speaker.UPDATE!!! I thought is was able to play in 'serial' mode which the speaker said it was in but it is still only left and right when connected. I didn't really notice it with the music I was playing but caught on after some music with more separation. I reached out to Tribit on this and they said it only paired in stereo mode but not at all a deal breaker but it would be nice to have this feature.The nice touch for using them together is that once linked they remember the mode you are connected in (stereo or serial) so when you turn them on they link together again automatically. The volume of both is controlled by my phone so they both go up and down with the one control and if you turn one off when connected the other powers down as well. The only slightly negative things I have with this is sometimes if my phone is on me in my pocket and I am working at a lower level in the yard behind a retaining wall the Bluetooth can get a little spotty but works fine when I leave the yard and go in the house and even stays connected if I go into the front yard.The other thing I would like to see is some sort of visual indicator of the battery life on the speaker itself, maybe adding that as an option when cycling the LED modes. As of now I need to open the app to check the battery.The app is only OK but getting better as I have had a 3-4 updates to it since my first one was ordered in March.Beyond that I really could not be happier with this purchase and I have two of them new ($320 with a $40 coupon for each and STILL currently available as of 7/31/24) for significantly less than a single JBL Boombox 3 new ($500) or 'renewed' ($375).I am no super geek audiophile but to me and many others that have heard this it sounds great to us and really fills the yard with sound and good bass so I highly recommend this speaker!","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2024",AHSIGPKSADGJ3Y3ARZDGYVQBQYBA,True,4,
R1M5UBI9XI0S16,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars My review vs soundcore boom 2 plus,John,5,"So quickly going over the differencesThe weight. The soundcore isn't light, but the tribit is noticeably heavierAppearance. I personally like the soundcore. For both I don't like the lights. I'm sure they drain battery and I just don't care for them.Sound. To me, out of the box, the soundcore just sounds downright bad. I immediately wanted to return it upon hearing it. That's actually why I bought the tribit, yeah it sounds that bad. The tribit took a few days to arrive and during that time I played with the soundcore. I found some random guys eq and it made things definitely better. The soundcore is a lot newer and I didn't find many eq online.... Or maybe I just don't know where to find them. I'm posting mine that I'm slowly tweaking, but sounds a million times better than what it comes with. I have no idea why soundcore launched what that preset. As for the tribit it sounds much better right out of the box with stock preset. So if you hear comparison videos online like I did, the tribit is just going to sound better, hands down, but doesn't have a ton of room to get better (from my experience)From here I'm comparing using my posted eq for soundcore b2+ and Alan Ross eq for tribit. Keep in mind I'm no audiophile nor do I know the terminology that well.The sound is pretty similar. What jumps or to me is that in things like rock music, the soundcore has like this noise. I'm not sure if muddy is the word, but it sounds like some sounds can just run together, doesn't sound super clean. It doesn't sound awful, just switching back and forth with the tribit, it's noticable. The tribit on the other hand just doesn't have that... It's like it's just not there, it's cleaner. But when listening to volume around 60%+ I can hear the tribit distorting, which doesn't happen on the soundcore.On louder volumes, that muddy or whatever sound on the soundcore kinda makes it feel full, kinda like a concert or something. When the tribit is turned all the way up, I mean it doesn't sound bad, but it sounds a little more empty. It's hard to explain, but that's all I can do. I don't know if it is, but it makes the soundcore sound a lot louder. It's more fun to sing along to at high volumes(drowns out my own voice more lol)My suggestion is if this is for outdoor use/you wanna jam out at high volume and sing along to, get the soundcore. If you want cleaner music for lower volumes especially inside, get the tribit.The both pump it crazy amounts of bass. Since I'm using mine virtually 100% outdoor, the soundcore is what I'm keeping","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2024",AGUC7ZJPKZD6VBLUFWETB2ILOJDA,True,3,
R3A5OMLEB9E0OA,B09PMYTJD2,"4.0 out of 5 stars Heavy, and no phone calls, but music is great",Dman,4,"I struggled between getting this Tribit Stormbox, or the W-King 80w, for months. I got this tribit instead of the W, since I have had and still have 4 or 5 ? Tribit devices (from earbuds to Stormbox Micro 2), and their sound is always good, they dont lie about how long their devices will play for, they dont lie about bass, their usb ports have NEVER gone out on me because they were loose or cheaply made/applied, and their tech support is as good as Anker is (top 2 support companies on Amazon says me and many others), and also the Tribit was 10w louder, lol.Anyway, the 1st thing I did with this was charge it, 2nd was play music on it.Most of my music I have is mids/high type, and this didnt disappoint me much about a softer bass. BUT, for those musicians who I do like with lots of bass, I was thinking: man, this is kinda low bass. THEN I remembered there was a Bass Boost button! And man, when you hit that thing, it is perfect (to my ears, and for no$5k setup mind you). The Bass Boost REALLY does boost the bass, without drowning out the mids and highs. Dont ask me how the do it, but they do.The wireless reaction time from my phone is instantaneous on this boombox (unlike the micro 2, which has about a .5 second delay).I have been trying to get my computer speakers to work on my tv because there isnt any bass since the speaker bar wireless bass/rears went out, so I hooked this Tribit boombox to my TV ! LOL Funny thing is, is that it actually works, even though I still have the speaker bar hooked into my tv. It takes a few minutes to get the speaker bar and the Tribit to sound evenly (since I have the Tribit next to my bed between my tv with speaker bars and the Tribit acting as bass and Left Rear, lol), but once it does man does it sound good. There is a little delay when my tv is paired with the Tribit, but I know its from me having an old tv, with wireless 3.x or 4.0 max, and also with 2 sound bars hooked up to it (man I wish my 1st sound bar bass/rear didnt go out on me. I cant afford another $700 to $1100 for just a sound bar bass and rear).Anyway, this Tribit is 'almost' what I was looking for, so here comes the Negs/Wishes.]There is NO Remote control. Why not? Because we should be able to stand up every time we change the channel, or the next song is blaringly loud, or too soft, or we actually want to have a conversation with someone next to us and its too loud? Very big missed chance here, assuming we will just use our phones to sound up/down? You have to find the right loudness on both the Tribit and the whatever-it-is you are doing on the phone to have to turn it up/down also? What about when we are on a call, and cant turn the Tribit off, higher or lower? Oh, just turn your music off from the phone you are talking on! Right.......When I turn the Tribit lights off, I dont want to have to turn them off EVERY time I adjust the volume on it. Big mistake having the lights tuned to the Tribit sound up/down (when you physically have to get up, go to the Tribit box, find the sound button, turn it up or down, go back to where you were and see if it is loud enough or not, and keep doing that all day/night long? What about when you arent using your phone, and have music on a usb thumb drive? Way too many scenarios where a remote control would have upped this a star. No way. Another reason why a remote is good in these situations. On, Off, Up, Down sound, turn lights off completely (heck, put a light bar on the remote, so we can see if it is topping out or not), Last song, Next song. Not much to ask for, right? A remote control goes a LONG way on a limited product like this.Did I say this thing is heavy? It really is. I had an older product like this, with more features, that weighed 1/2 or less than this Tribit. A carrying strap would have been nice! Or a bag? Or something, even rubber handle over the plastic would make hauling this around much nicer.Did I say Limited? Yes, I did. This tribit does 2 things, play music from app and lights. Thats it. No Radio (I know, only us old folk listen to the radio). No cd player. No Time/Day/Date etc (would be nice to be able to use this as an Alarm clock. USB port for thumb drives? Port for sd/micro sdhc cards?Power bank? What device is NOT more portable for a power bank? Or even less pricey? I have a 5 hour bank charger I got for $30 that will power my phone longer than this thing when it is not plugged in, lol. Although, I did say they never lie about their products run time, and 30 hours IS a long time, so maybe a power bank is ok, except most of us have our phones in our hands, on a 1/4 pound or less charger if need be, not laying next to a digital dj, heh. Seems this was just one of those Checkbox 'features' because there arent any features (mostly because that would require a remote control for? maybe).AUX In? Hello, phones dont have a 3.5mm port anymore. Or are we supposed to tie ourselves to the Tribit, yet again, and carry a 3.5mm to usb-c cable around? Maybe we could put it in the Tribit carry bag...Oh, wait, there isnt one. Heh.Overall, for what I use it for, its almost perfect. And it seems W-K is going down this road now also with their new lineup (I was choosing between this and the squared W-K back before the new sleeker W-K came out). Except for a remote control, just to turn up or lower volume, and turn it on off (basically a remote that has the buttons on top of the Stormbox, this thing is almost perfect for me, except when I have to lug it somewhere else in the room. Tribit does 2 things VERY well, and those are Sound quality which this has, and real Time mentioned on how long it runs, which is usually on the lower side rather than the higher side. And Tech Support, so 3 things. I havent needed support for this Stormbox, so its 2 for now.Recommended?Yes. If you are strong enough to lug this thing around, just want to play great sounding music outside while you sit, or do yardwork, or have lots of parties. Oh, also if you want to use it for your tv speakers instead of the tinny sounding wimpy ones that come with tv's nowadays, lol.I almost gave it 5 stars, it is that good, but w/o a remote control and very limited use, I just cant give it a 5.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2023",AH5TKVDNNG6H27AILTCIDTCUCXEQ,True,24,
R2CEBO9M8ZDN0S,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars A MOVIE THEATER SPEAKER to have at home.,"Terry Wilkerson, Jr.",5,"The media could not be loaded. The packaging and the expedient of the arrival of my speaker arrived on time and were in great condition. I wasn't expecting all of the box and foam that came inside this to keep it well protected. I love that.Now, this is my second introduction to Tribit and I really love this company and this speaker specifically I really, really love beyond infinity. I wish I could give this speaker more than 5 stars because this is amazing.I had my first Tribit StormBox Blast delivered on June 23 for my personal testing since I mostly use the speakers I have (Tribit and JBL) for movies and very little for music and the second one I got on June 30 this year (2024). Let me tell you that the performance of just 1 Tribit StormBox Blast is out of this world. When I was testing my speaker inside of my house at 50% volume within ear shot, oh my God. This speaker is a literal movie theater speaker and that is mostly because of the XBass button on the top of it and even without it on it still gives off that impression. I was testing the Alien: Romulus teaser trailer since that is the best option to use and when I went to the theaters a month before I got this speaker, I remembered the sound and everything when they showed the preview for it and it sounds exactly like the theatrical experience. I am not exaggerating when this speaker was literally shaking my room, with or without my door closed and that I could feel the wind from it. I do not believe it is advertised as a movie theater speaker but it is indeed that. Amazing job Tribit. I suppose that the size of the speaker is why it able to do that but I digress.I love bright colors and the appearance of the LED lights I love and this speaker is very easy to use. As you can see, I have put a video of my 1st speaker at the time and the connectivity of this speaker is 150 feet and I could hear the music and dialog from movies from that far away as if you were a little bit closer to it. It does start cutting out when you are pass the 150 ft. mark but if you have your phone connected to it, I suggest leaving it by the speaker and go the distance you want to go. I had to be at least 200 ft plus and I could hear everything very clearly and I had the speaker at max volume in order for that to work and the phone in the idea I mentioned. It really makes up the size for this speaker and the speaker is 12 pounds but is not heavy to me at all.I test and watch only movies with my speakers and now I have a second one of this speaker and I love it. Godzilla Minus One I tested when I watched the movie for the first time and yeah this is a movie theater speaker and I didn't see that movie in theaters but I know that is what that sounds like. Transformers 2007 I remember every sound when I saw that in theaters and that is exactly how it sounds and even more so. This speaker cost $200 but here on Amazon you can get a 40% discount and it bumps it to $160 to $170 depending on your shipping prefence. This is the best speaker I have ever gotten and do not intend on getting any other speaker. This speaker does have 30 hours of battery life as advertised but it is mostly due to the LED lights being shut off. With the lights it 24 hours or almost less. I watched three 2 hour movies and the Tribit app, in which you can customize the volume for this speaker, the battery was still at 70% or 50% left and that was with the lights and not plugged in. This is the best speaker I have ever purchased and have and I would highly recommend it. Especially if you love movies like me or if you really love music like me also. I wish there was more to elaborate on but this speaker is a BEAST.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024",AEGNH2USRR4LWRJMJHPQ2XGPZ6BA,True,2,
R37HN5S0QF9JGH,B09PMYTJD2,"4.0 out of 5 stars Sounds Like A $500 JBL Boombox, Can't Be Used In The Shower",Chase,4,"TLDR: Loud as hell, sounds great, plastics feel cheap, not so good at low volume, cannot handle prolonged splashes and sprays. Buy if you want something loud and cheap, don't buy for your shower or outdoor adventures.I bought this speaker due to its high rankings among various reviewers, and am blown away by the sound quality for a speaker around 1/3 the price of its closest competitor (the JBL Boombox series).My friends and I did a side-by-side sound test of the Tribit Stormbox Blast vs a JBL Boombox 2 and found them to be nearly indistinguishable at high volume. Both speakers play loud enough to be uncomfortable for extended indoor use and experience no noticeable distortion or clipping at maximum volume. Default EQ settings of the Tribit vs the JBL are different but both speakers allow for enough customization to suit most users' needs.To sound that good for 1/3 the cost, however, some cuts did have to be made. The two most noticeable are the build quality of the speaker and its low-volume performance. The Tribit speaker is heavy and feels as bulky as it sounds, but is constructed out of cheap-feeling plastic compared to the ""luxurious"" fabric and rubber overwrap on the JBL Boombox. This makes the speaker easier to dry, put stickers on, or attach third-party mounts to but does look and feel cheap.Low-volume performance is also significantly worse than that of the JBL, mostly due to the Tribit only having 16 volume levels. The gaps between them at low volumes are HUGE compared to those on smaller speakers (think five or six levels on something you could fit in your hand) and I personally find many situations where the only volume options are too quiet or too loud for low-volume use. This can be combatted by disabling Bluetooth absolute volume on your source device or using a source which does not support absolute volume (AUX input or older Bluetooth device). Both the Tribit and the JBL sound less clear and refined at lower volume than most smaller speakers, this is not a design flaw but rather an inherent property of speaker sizing.Another major drawback of the Tribit speaker compared to its more expensive competitors is its poor water resistance. The speaker is rated at IPX7 and can be submerged in water for short periods of time but will malfunction if exposed to splashes or spray for an extended period of time (use outdoors in the rain, inside a shower enclosure, etc). This malfunction usually involves the speaker quickly increasing to maximum volume while the controls fail to respond to inputs and appears to be caused by the use of a paper-based adhesive gasket to secure the control panel's rubber insert into the speaker body. For my use case this is a HUGE drawback but is something I am willing to deal with given the speaker's incredible performance as a high-volume boombox.Other aspects of the speaker mostly work as advertised. I have used the app to update firmware and it has worked without issue. Stereo mode works as well, with no apparent audio delay and full synchronization of the controls and lighting between the speakers. The lack of aptX support for a device with Bluetooth 5.3 hardware is quite unusual but I cannot hear a difference in audio quality, at least when streaming music through Spotify on a run-of-the-mill Android phone. I have yet to fully test battery life but the advertised figures appear accurate, at least based off the battery level shown in the app.In conclusion, I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a LOUD Bluetooth speaker, assuming your use case won't involve getting the speaker very wet. If you need a speaker which can be continuously used in wet environments, consider the JBL Boombox instead.Notes:- Ingress protection ratings are cumulative (e.g. a device rated at IPX5 is also rated at IPX4 and so on) only through level 6. Although most devices which can handle short-term submersion can also handle continuous splashes and sprays, it is possible to create one which cannot. Tribit is not making incorrect claims about the water resistance of their speaker (The Stormbox Blast does appear to meet IPX7 standards) but is rather advertising it in a way which may be misleading to some consumers.- Several of the issues with this speaker could be addressed through a firmware update, adding support for aptX Bluetooth audio, increasing the number of volume levels, etc. Given that the speaker has already received several firmware updates and is relatively new, I expect Tribit to improve on its functionality through future updates.- The water resistance of the speaker could be massively enhanced with some modifications. Several teardowns and analyses are available on the Internet as of the writing of this review, and the speaker is designed well from a water-resistance standpoint minus the issues with the control panel. I personally believe that a ""control panel protector"" could be installed on the top of the speaker and that this would allow it to handle splashes and sprays without issue.- The built-in power supply inside the speaker is massively convenient (makes the charger MUCH smaller than that of the JBL boombox) and is powerful enough to run the speaker at maximum volume continuously. Some other competitors (namely the Anker Soundcore Motion Boom Plus) do not have enough input power capacity to keep up with sustained high-volume use while plugged in. This is a big plus for the Tribit if your speaker will be used in a gym, dance studio, party house, or other situation where it'll rarely see low-volume or battery-operated use.- Most Bluetooth speakers which are covered in lights look cheap and tacky. Tribit does their lighting well, it is not obnoxious and can be turned off if desired. Several other reviewers have seen this as an issue but I personally have no problem with it.","Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2022",AGA6HJKPR346HRGADEFB22LP7V3A,True,141,

After watching some YouTube reviews I decided on the Tribit Stormbox Blast. My hope was that it would sound very comparable to the JBL Boombox since I've heard that one in person and was super impressed with the sound quality. While the Tribit sounds good, it's not at the same level of performance as the JBL especially at lower volumes. After reading so many positive reviews I had higher expectations on how it would sound. I feel the clarity and bass are much better with the JBL. With that said, the price point of the Tribit is substantially less which was a deciding factor in my purchase. Overall, the Tribit is a good value and I wanted to share my experience for those who might be comparing these two speakers.","Reviewed in the United States August 19, 2024",AGOMHDUWM2OYCJ6VOYTA5TCBCNSA,True,1,

The bass you get for the size is the best I've ever heard, and the max volume on thise device is more than I've ever needed. The battery life is probably the best part, because I've never had to charge it after a single extended use case, I was able to get multiple hour long sessions out of the device which far beats any other speaker I've ever owned which only have enough juice for a couple hours.","Reviewed in the United States August 13, 2024",AERN57C3NFEDCXUEORU2KYD6MCEA,True,1,

R31R54V3YVDVS2,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars Beastly Box with great low frequencies. App EQ availability is a plus,Vic,5,"The media could not be loaded. Over the years I’ve own many speakers from small to large. I was also a nightclub stagehand and sound guy for years and now with technology getting better and better everything that you use to have to pay an arm and leg for you can get for a fair price. I always wanted to get a bluetooth speaker that has it all, this one is for sure “bang for your buck”. A great value for sure. I’ve had it for about 2 months and I hope it’ll last. Time will tell, but I’m still smiling from the day I took it out of the box. I listen to music everywhere and when my living space tv’s sound got dull this added so much life back to the experiences while watching shows and films. I’m thinking to myself if this was out a half decade before it would of been an easier decision to not spend sixteen hundred on a home theatre system.Out of the box the EQs are not for everyone, pretty good for what they are. Being able to adjust it is a smart move on the company’s part. I included pictures of a universal “U” shape eq setting if you think the “music” or “xbass” eqs are lacking in the highs. this will bring the out bass without drowning out everything else. It’s a nice balance for most genres that need the low and high end to shine (dance, hip hop, latin, meditation, rock).Weighs about 12-15lbs.The battery life claims are probably based on lights off with volume on lowest setting, which isn’t a lie but useless, unless you’re in a sound proof room.With 2 nights of full sleep without interruption I get about a good 16 hours on 30% volume on charge with lights off on my u shape eq with heavy bass before the low battery warning comes on.Updates through the app are easy and simple. The lights are fun but basic with only two settings. Hopefully they add more later. I love this speaker and have nothing to really complain about. I don’t mind the look, feel, weight, size, or anything about it, but the low battery warning has me a little annoyed. I’ll let you know the reason.My wife has high anxiety and we play relaxing sleep beats or sleep frequencies for her to doze off to most nights. So this is a heads up for anyone who wants to use this to bed. When the battery is low, It will constantly let you know with a voice warning that will interrupt your sleep. It a nice feature to have but I got annoyed because for people who use it for sleep like I do you’ll be rudely awaken to shut it off or plug it in. It’s not adjustable in the app. I’ve ask the manufacturer if they’ll include it in the future, and they just stated it’s built in for the user to know the battery is low. My guess is it’s to prolong the battery and keep it from draining all the way for future fails. Not a big deal still a great speaker with lots to love. I have taken it out to the parties, parks and beaches(where my last favorite speaker the 70w w-king x11 would be competing for space, especially against crowds and waves sounds) I am actually going to buy a second one to have stereo pairing. I think the sounds for the price would be great and more portable then a jbl party box 100.(Also try to produce music on the side check out it out on Spotify, Apple Music and here on Amazon Music.

I know there are better boom boxes out there, but for 160.00 this box surprised me. It ticked off all the wants. The only drawbacks are its weight of 12 pounds and no shoulder strap.

The sound is very good overall including having good bass, and I’m someone who has subwoofers in my home/vehicle/boat. It made a slight rattle with one woofer one time but it was extremely cold, probably 10 degrees Fahrenheit. Outside of that I’ve used it in lots of cold weather during Michigan winters.

Most speakers loose bass because they do not provide enough power. The Tribit has the power needed.This is the first BT speaker in it price range that has blown me away! I like my JBL Extremes but would trade them for this any day.Battery life is not what is advertised for any volume above 20%. For the sound that it puts out at 40%, this is understandable. It maintains the bass up until ~80%, then loses some to prevent distortion. It is LOUD at 3/4 volume level.One thing I like about Tribit speakers is the designed ability for the speaker to be tilted back. This prevents any sound interference from bouncing off the flat surface this may set down on while playing. It makes a difference.The X-bass button is really not needed with this speaker and a decent music source. The bass punches with zero distortion at most sane listening levels. People complain about weight...really? This thing puts 90w of very good sound quality at volume. That means a heavy battery and speaker magnets. I like the lights which can be turned off. It pairs easily with all my devices.These can be paired according to the manual, I do not have a second one to test this. I do NOT use the app, I just use an MP3 player app with good EQ. I do not know if the app is required to pair two of these.

Weight is nowhere near as bad as some reviews make it out to be, u can carry without an issue, and you can always figure out a strap for it, i used one from a wking d7, which this is only slightly heavier than, use your imagination! I would say this one is better indoors and placed in the right place, gotta experiment, outdoors is ok but if out in the wide open you lose that bass reflection, but that would be the same with any speaker. I don't care about lights, wife likes them, whatever! The app is kind of lackluster, I don't even use it, i have an eq in my phone that works through Spotify so no need. Biggest disappointment for me is the battery, they claim 30hrs, we all know not to ever expect that, however, i used 80% after 12hrs at about the 50% volume, with xbass on, half the time was with lights on. There's no situation i can see myself playing this thing at a much lower volume in order to get close to the 30hrs. All in all, i would say it's a decent speaker, probably one of the best in this category of total portability, you can realistically take it anywhere, whereas the next step up is like a pathfinder or something which is much more bulky and much less portable. I'm ok with it at the $150 mark but at the suggested $199 my opinion drops a little bit, however, for the price of one jbl you can have two of these and you're gonna be a much more satisfied listener! Update, picked up a second one, sounds pretty dang good, especially in a decent size room, you can have a pretty good house party with these things, i set them up diagonal from each other in the corners, facing each other, completely fills the room, and the bass reverb is awesome, you can definitely feel it!","Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2023",AHJUKLY33QDOC47SQWLMOXMHHVEA,True,3,

Useable app EQ (which you'll need for it to sound it's best, flashy lights, and at least as portable as a medium dog with a handle on it (it's super heavy, for no perceivable benefit to sound relative to other decent-sounding speakers). Nothing this size is ever going to sound truly amazing, but what does come out is relatively impressive - nice job engineers. It does not sound good enough to excuse how hard it is to look at it. It's ugly. Ugly. Alpha. Foxtrot. It is definitely a box, and it has a little boom, but calling it a boombox is an insult to the likes of a JVC RC-M90. This whole class of speakers look like the interior of a 92 Camaro, but this one is . . . extra. Extra big, extra bulky, extra tacky plastic. This thing ought to give me prize tickets when I push play. How about we lose the lights (it would sound as good without inducing seizures) and pay for some designers that didn't spend thirty years at Fischer Price wishing they could work in black.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2024",AH4IK33PEHKRAWZCXKDSIJDENERQ,True,2,

The speakers I was using in my garage just really didn't cut it, so I started doing some research and came across this one and decided to give it a try.Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect because I've never heard of this company, but I am so glad I did. The speaker sounded pretty good when I first powered it up and paired it. I thought it would have more bass but was happy with what I heard. But then I saw the ""Xbass"" button on the top and after pressing that -- MAGIC happened and the music flowed with clarity and deep bass like I haven't heard before in a small portable speaker setup.It really has impressed me and sounds amazing, and the LEDs are also fun. I do recommend installing the app and linking it to the speakers, because the 2nd LED option I think is better visually, but that's my opinion of the color patterns.I've been using it for a while now and the battery is still over 95% so I have no idea how long this will last but it's clearly a long time!I'm glad I bought this one and will be getting one for my brother for his birthday.","Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2024",AEKP7K7G62IHTOPZ6NID5XK6GJ7A,True,4,

R3N3VLP49J4C5,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing For the $$$,Brent James Pourciau,5,"Ok let me first start off by saying I generally put a ridiculous amount of researching multiple brands and different variations of products before purchasing it. Now with that said I can confidently say I made the right choice. I had never heard of Tribit but the reviews outweighed all else so I got it during a lighting deal. Now I already own a Bose sound link and a Bose mini sound link an both of those sound quite good for their size, as expected for a name like Bose…so yesterday after my speaker that sat on the charger 2 nites prior finally got turned on an I was greeted with a pleasant power up cycle of musical key notes instead of the typical bleep, I went into Bluetooth on my iPhone an there it we’d already in there I guess on 1st time pairs at goes into pairing mode so ya super easy…then I connected it to the app I downloaded out the Apple Store which allows you to have a custom EQ or several presets including the X bass feature which is certainly noticeable depending on the song. You can change the synced light show in there see the power status remaining snd so on…I saw a prompt to upgrade to the latest firmware ED. So I did very simple an fast! Now onto the sound I’ll make this easy coming from a musician an audiophile, the Mids are good not great but very exceptional the lows are pretty impressive for a Bluetooth speaker the Highs are well above average for a speaker in this price range and class . I played it for About 2 plus hours steady with the light show an making changes all throughout an at power off it still had 83% remaining, an I was romping it! To sum up I believe I made the right choice…I can’t see where I would find a more powerful great sounding relaxing or partying up Bluetooth speaker anywhere else for this price and be just as happy. If you’ve never really trusted in reviews before let me assure ya I’m extremely scrutinizing of products before purchasing’ don’t worry about researching any further if this is the type of product your looking for fun at the beach or Chilling at home then believe me when I say your search is over! There are many speaker types out there that look similar to this and I’m glad I got this one! Hope This helps your decision making..

R29WJB922A1FY8,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars I'm keeping it anyway.,Amazon Customer,5,"The media could not be loaded. I speaker shopped for a while. Small space so I need hard hitting base and I won't compromise on a full range dynamic sound either. Some of these, even highly rated or well known names, just can't give you what you need in a compact speaker. SUFFER NO MORE my fellow audiophiles this, hits on all levels. I was looking at Bose, Klipsch Nakamichi and so on but it was comments made in a Harman Kardin review that led me here. I've never heard this quality in such a small package. I had to order it twice. Not to have 2 of them but because the first one""Got lost"" about half a mile away on a warm March evening. Long story and not mine to tell lol. Took it out of the box and it Bluetoothed right up.

RJY2NHU4RQMZ7,B09PMYTJD2,"5.0 out of 5 stars Loud, quality sound to fill your next party or outdoor boogie",Forrest Ruby,5,"At first glance this thing looks a little cheesy. The rainbow light show on the front is a major feature of this boombox and I was hesitant to get it, despite the rave reviews about the quality and loudness of the sound it produces, because it doesn't look like something a man in his 30s would own. Having taking it camping, adventuring, and partying all over the last six months I can say honestly the light show is an attraction about this thing. The rainbow lights dance to the music and fill a dark space with some much needed energy, and it can be changed to solid colors that will change occasionally (though you don't control that), or you can turn them off entirely.That out of the way, let's talk sound. This boombox is loud, and it will easily fill a gathering of a couple dozen people in or outdoors. The bass is really powerful as well and it really takes the energy up a notch when people can feel the bass. It can be boosted as well if that is your preference, and I haven't yet found a loudness at which either the speaker drivers or the woofer plates bleed or cackle. This is a solid device that will deliver you very good sounding playback with the added benefit of powerful bass and an entertaining light show.It is deceptively heavy, because of the sizable rechargeable non-removable battery but the carry handle is built right into the frame for ease of movement. For the price of this thing you are putting yourself in the same range as comparable BT speakers from name brands that sell for 50-100% more. Coming across the review for Tribit on PC Mag was a great find, and I'm glad I gave this brand and box a try. My friends are converts as well and two others have already bought smaller models for their own use.

R2ZXEY7IFNEG53,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars Its heavy and loud,Keon B. Billings,5,"I was skeptical about the battery, life claims, and about the alleged base that this thing puts out. I can now officially say humbly and with respect that this thing delivers even more so than some reviewers claimed. The base is impressively deep and rich given the size of the speakers, and the battery life went for several hours for me without losing volume. I cannot attest to its acclaimed battery life, but it ran several hour for me, and I am more than happy with its performance.Don't go getting any bright ideas this single speaker can power your house party by itself fill the entire room with sound, etc. etc. It is definitely loud, it definitely have a lot of base for its size, and the battery life is impressive. However, please be realistic in your expectations. When you blast any system, no matter who makes it, Bose, JBL, Sony, beats, it doesn't matter. The higher you push the volume, the more battery it uses, and the shorter your playtime will be. That's just a basic fact of electronics and battery life.That said, this unknown company Tribit have a gem on their hands with this speaker box. I highly recommend it.As for the weight of this thing, I can only assume that it's weight is due to the charge circuit and electronics is inside the unit. Most portable units have a single USB connection that charges the device from an external charge adapter or some other unit plugged into the wall. In the case of this device, all those electronics are packaged inside the unit and seeing that it's enclosed, I'm pretty sure they use more beefy components than normal. That plus the accompanying batteries I believe added up to the weight. Knowing this information, I am more than happy because now I don't have to look for a charger adapter to charge my Bluetooth speaker because it's already inside, I just need to plug it in.If you have not already figured it out, I highly recommend the speaker. It's plenty loud, it's got lots of headroom for highs and lows, and they have great battery life.

I now own two of their products and am very impressed. That is the very most important thing, of course, when you buy stereo equipment. There is an app you can download that has an EQ which is nice.Sadly, the unit is VERY heavy. What in the world is in there? Second, there are only two lighting options on the unit. So I downloaded the app...only the same two options. Both options are bright and way to busy (multiple colors that sync to the beat). Tribit desperately needs to revamp this to keep up with brands like JBL and Sony. Their Bluetooth speakers allow for wonderful, adjustable ambient lighting. The Stormbox lighting is clearly designed for 14 year old kids having a party (or older people who enjoy inducing their own seizures LOL). Fortunately, there is a third option...OFF.Because the app did not offer any more lighting options, and because I use the EQ in my music app, I deleted the app.Overall, for sound quality, I highly recommend this. For those complaining that there is not enough bass, use the EQ feature on your music app or the Tribit app. You will be just fine.For portability, I do not because of the weight. The lights are also very annoying.Finally, for those complaining that there is no radio, try reading the product information before you buy!!","Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2023",AH4F6BGQJMB6XW5TJLLUM55BQV7Q,True,4,

I have wanted to buy a larger portable Bluetooth speaker for a while that was water resistant but JBL is very expensive. I wanted to replace my 4 Flip5s with one big speaker, my batteries are shot on those, but after over 5 years, they did very well. This Tribiy delivers. It sounds great, the bass button is awesome, really fills a room and it gets LOUD. I wish the sound went more directions like JBLs, but what does come out sounds amazing. Played with it a few hours and hasn't moved off 100% battery life. I also like the light show, there are two options or you can turn it off, side lights indicate volume. I know it's not loud in my video but the volume isn't even at 30% and it's much louder in person, I wanted to show off the lights lol. I love the buttons, the center circle is multi function and you can skip back and forth, play/pause with one button, and the volume buttons are dedicated. The app is awesome because it has all that functionality as well as access to preset equalizers and the ability to make your own. Super easy to set up and learn the functions. You can also use it to charge electronics of the usb-C on the back which will be very handy. I bought the carrying case and it basically covers enough to carry it by strap, which is awesome. I wish it had a compartment to put the charging cord in but I doubt you'll need to charge it during a day or night of use.

I'll go into details below, but I can confidently say that I've experienced few pieces of technology that are more unreliable and frustrating than the Boom 3 speakers when trying to get them paired together and playing the same audio.First, the Ultimate Ears Boom app is a huge frustration. Getting even a single speaker to show up in the app can require multiple disconnects, app force quits, and speaker restarts. Once a primary speaker shows up in the UE Boom app, getting other speakers to show up is near impossible. Each and every day I want to use the speakers together, I have to go through a 20-minute process of forgetting Bluetooth settings, repairing, and powering off and on speakers. It is such a frustrating process that I usually rage quit and forgo using the speakers together.Then, once the speakers are connected together they regularly start clicking and thumping as they stutter during audio playback. Even when I move the two speakers within a foot of each other and the audio source, they regularly and constantly stutter and lose bits of audio. Listening to an entire song without missing parts is impossible when using the Ultimate Ears Boom speakers together in Party Up or Two-Up mode.Simply put, THESE SPEAKERS DO NOT WORK WHEN PAIRED TOGETHER. The Boom speakers are completely worthless when used together as the audio they play is unlistenable.I really enjoyed the single Ultimate Ears Boom speaker I used on its own for about two years, but after experiencing the disaster which is Party Up mode and the Ultimate Ears Boom app, I will never again purchase another Ultimate Ears product. This experience has just been too frustrating and I've wasted $300 on two speakers I cannot use together.","Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2018",AFN57XUWIRHZ24FA7IVOW5HXLL2Q,True,284,Color: Sunset RedPattern: Speaker
R3E39REOEKMJHO,B07DD3WBYW,2.0 out of 5 stars DO NOT BUY: Ruined my relationship with ULTIMATE EARS :(,Hailey DeArruda,2,"💗Let me start by saying before buying this product I have been a HUGE, longtime fan of the Ultimate Ears brand.I purchased the original Wonderboom portable bluetooth speaker maybe 5 years ago or longer? I originally purchased it because I wanted something waterproof that I could use in the shower. It was GREAT for that purpose, and also proved to be an awesome all-around portable bluetooth speaker. Sound quality was great for the price range and size. Volume was SUPER as well. I loved the big loop on the back that you could hang on all sorts of things. I LOVE the concept of the Magic Button in the center to Play, Pause & Skip. The Skip Feature is ESPECIALLY hard to find on a speaker in this price range and I love it for use at work when I may not be able to easily access my phone. Bluetooth connection was great. Battery life originally lasted anywhere between 4-6hrs at least which was great. THIS SPEAKER LASTED ME AT LEAST 5 YEARS with little to no change in quality. I LOVED THIS SPEAKER! Unfortunately, I left it at work one week when I was on vacation and just left it there figuring my coworkers could use it and would respect it enough. Long story short, I came back and it wasn't working as well or holding a charge properly. It was a sad end to a good story.🔍Finally, I find myself in need of a new speaker. Because I LOVED my original WONDERBOOM so much, I decided to search within the Ultimate Ears line.((It also just so happens at my current job our department owns two WONDERBOOM2 speakers! I've noticed their battery life doesn't work as well, but they still worked pretty decent.))So I wanted one of the newest, nicest speakers in the Ultimate Family. The Hyperboom was too large to transport from home and work, and cost way more than I was looking to spend, so that was out of the question. So immediately I decided to research between the BOOM3 & the MEGABOOM3. In conclusion, through reviews I read I concluded that most consumers felt the bass was overpowering for the Megaboom3 with no real volume increase, and simply diminished the quality of the sound. SO, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE BOOM3!1️⃣🆕First impression out of the box, it looked nice enough. I preferred the more compact design of the Wonderboom, and DEFINITELY missed the larger, more practical loop. It still has the magic button which is a HUGE selling point to me and very accommodating.I charged it up to 100% and decided to unplug it and test it out for a while at home. It worked well, sounded almost exactly like the Wonderboom as far as sound QUALITY. I might be wrong but as far as VOLUME goes I feel it may have had the same volume limitations as the original Wonderboom, if anything maybe SLIGHTLY louder. However, I was happy it seemed to be fully functioning and worked just as well as my other one.I also liked that in addition to that, I was able to use the Ultimate Ears app in conjunction with the product to REMOTE START the speaker from my phone. Again, this is another HUGE selling point to me because I mainly use this product at work. It also has an EQUALIZER function which is definitely cool, although I don't feel like it's very accurate. It also has some sort of feature where you can set certain clicks on the Magic Button to play certain playlists automatically, which sounds cool although I never got to personally try it.All in all, it seemed like a good replacement at first.⚠️🪫THE NEXT DAY COMES & HERE IS WHERE THE PROBLEMS BEGIN. I come into work with my charger FULLY charged at 100%. I use Remote-Start on the app to turn on the speaker. The Remote-Start feature also displays the approximate battery percentage (by 10% increments) of the speaker. At this point, my speaker was at 100% charge.I used the speaker for between 1.5hrs<2hrs before it gave me the Low Battery warning for 10%. So, I put it on the charger and continued to let it play. It lasted maybe another 20minutes, before it died.Now this is VERY disappointing considering my ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM that came out 5+ years ago would last for 4-6hrs on FULL VOLUME without being on a charger. Not only that, but the ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM would ALSO last for a WHILE on the charger even when battery wasn't full.This was disappointing, but didn't seem like a crisis, just a bit sad.The next day, is when the BIGGER issue began. I admittedly forgot to charge my BOOM3 when I got home the night before, and then brought it to work. When I wake up, I charge it until I leave for 1.5HOURS!When I arrive at work, I charge it for an additional 1HOUR before, checking the battery percentage on the app which reads 60%. So, I decide to turn it on and use it while STILL LEAVING IT ON THE CHARGER. NOT EVEN 30 MINUTES GO BY UNTIL THE SPEAKER DIES!!!!!!!!! So, irritated I turn it off, opt for my AirPods and leave the speaker to charge for a few hours. I let this SPEAKER CHARGE FOR 4 MORE HOURS BEFORE USING IT. Finally, I check the battery on the app which only says 40%????? So I turn on the speaker and leave it plugged in, IT LASTS FOR LESS THAN ONE SONG BEFORE DYING!LET ME TELL YOU, THIS SPEAKER BROUGHT OUT PURE RAGE IN ME AT WORK. 🪫⚠️😡I feel so pissed, and cheated and ripped off. I was such a big fan and advocate for the Ultimate Ears brand, but how are you gonna sell me a NEWER, MORE EXPENSIVE speaker and MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY worse. Considering this is the BOOM3, I WOULD HOPE & ASSUME IT IS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL WONDEBOOM FROM 5 YEARS AGO, BUT I GUESS NOT. Thanks, Logitech, just charge me more money for a FAR INFERIOR PRODUCT, with the illusion that is going to be somewhat improved. However; this speaker is simply, for my needs- UNUSABLE & FRUSTRATING!!! HUUUUUGE DOWNGRADE 👎😢Very, very disappointed in the Ultimate Ears brand for putting out this one. Like I sad it really is a shame because I was a HUGE supporter of their brand and unfortunately this product was so disappointing and frustrating that it has ruined my relationship with this company for good.I loved the convenience of the Magic Button with the Skip Feature, the portability, durability, great waterproof technology, super big, useful loop, the sound quality & volume, and the battery life of ORIGINAL WONDERBOOM, but this product has ruined all that unfortunately.⚠️DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SAVE YOUR MOMEY 💸 BECAUSEYOU WILL NEED TO RETURN IT & REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER SPEAKER!!!!!!! THIS SPEAKER IS NOT FUNCTIONAL! ⚠️Sorry, Ultimate Ears, but do better.","Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2022",AFSWDPDFGUZCY4TIBMKU2QD3275A,True,148,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

R1XX4TUH1QR3UL,B07DD3WBYW,"4.0 out of 5 stars Buena calidad de sonido, pero...",Jorge Sarmiento,4,"Llevo tres meses utilizando el BOOM 3 y me parece pertinente hablar de sus características. Empecemos por las cosas buenas:1. CALIDAD DE SONIDOEs necesario resaltar la calidad tan excelsa de sonido que tiene este parlante. Los entendidos sabemos que la conexión por Bluetooth acarrea pérdida considerable en la calidad del sonido. Sin embargo, he de decir que el BOOM 3 me sorprendió sobremanera: agudos y medios en su punto y los bajos, aunque poco notorios y exagerados, son cómodos y audibles.2. VOLUMEN Y POTENCIAEl BOOM 3 es ideal para aquellos que quieran utilizarlo en una habitación pequeña o en una reunión o fiesta. Esto es así porque puede llegar a ser discreto y a la vez muy potente sin llegar a afectar demasiado la calidad de sonido.3. WATERPROOFNo he testeado el parlante sumergiéndolo de lleno en agua, pero se ha llegado a mojar levemente y hasta el momento no ha presentado problemas.Llegó la hora de hablar de lo malo:1. CARGA Y BATERÍASi bien es cierto que la duración de la batería no es el fuerte de este aparato, uno esperaría más por algo que cuesta más de cien dólares. Hay aparatos muchísimo más económicos que tienen una carga más duradera independientemente del uso. Si usas el BOOM 3 discretamente, la batería puede durar más de 10 horas non-stop. Pero si usas el BOOM 3 con el volumen máximo, la carga solo te va a durar cuatro o cinco horas (a menos que lo uses mientras esté conectado a la energía). Se entiende que se hayan decantado por un uso más discreto y se hayan enfocado en un parlante que provea una calidad de sonido óptima, pero repito: este parlante cuesta más de cien dólares y me parece que la batería quedó a deber.2. BUGS Y FUNCIONALIDADES INÚTILESEl botón Magic está muy bien pero tiene muchos defectos. Por ejemplo, no reconoce si laa playlists que añadas están en aleatorio y las termina reproduciendo por default. El conectar dos parlantes con la app me parece genial pero dudo mucho que alguien lo vaya a usar del todo. Con la app de Ultimate Ears no siempre puedes conectarte al aparato y en esos casos debes encenderlo manualmente. Hubo una vez que el aparato no respondía a la conexión y, debido a que la caja no incluye un manual de instrucciones, tuve que buscar en internet para ver cómo lo reseteaba por defecto.Resumiendo:Buena calidad de sonido, buena potencia y buena resistencia al agua. Mala distribución de la carga y mal sistema de conexión.¿Vale la pena comprarlo? Depende de cómo lo quieras usar. Si pretendes usar un parlante para un uso más doméstico y disfrutar de la música en una calidad de sonido decente, este es tu producto. Pero si quieres algo más profesional o externo, puedes conseguir algo mejor.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2023",AE55TVZYQ4SFDSGABXMU7JPEDKFA,True,14,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

R10AD2QSAZA36K,B07DD3WBYW,4.0 out of 5 stars Preferred this over Bose and JBL speakers,Tyler Cash,4,"I went to a Best Buy to look at portable bluetooth speakers. I was able to compare bluetooth speakers from Bose, JBL, and Ultimate Ears. Of all the speakers I listened to at this size and price point, this had the best sound. Best Buy didn't have any BOOM 3 speakers in stock, so I ordered from Amazon. Its been a definite upgrade from my previous similarly sized portable bluetooth speaker, with stronger bass hits and bigger sound overall. The bigger (and more expensive) speakers I listened to sounded better for sure, but the BOOM 3 does great for a more affordable speaker of its size.Its no audiophile speaker. It's tuned for popular music, with particular emphasis on bass and percussive hits. Which is fine, since that's what I was looking for and expecting from a speaker of this size and price. It does a decent job with today's top-40 style music. I don't listen to much rap or R&B, but I think it would do great with those genres as well. Music like Olivia Rodriguez's ""Good 4 U"" was pretty satisfying to listen to. Ultimate ears even provides an app where you can EQ the sound to something that you personally like even better.Music like ""Tightrope"" from the Greatest Showman soundtrack or ""Zanarkand"" from Final Fantasy Distant Worlds was a different story. They sounded muddy and lacked detail in a very unsatisfying way. I don't thing the EQ app can do anything to help that out. You'll want a different speaker if you're looking for a speaker for vocal, orchestral, jazz, etc.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2022",AFHDPQ3WBQQMUQNB46TWQCOSHXPQ,True,21,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

One was perfect the other didn’t charge. Such easy replacement from Amazon, got it the next day. This one is perfect. You can pair them together to get stereo sound. The sound is phenomenal, pairing is so simple. One of the best speakers out there. I have chosen it over Bose everyday, and I am a Bose girl.If you want immense sound and need it to be easy get any of the wonderboom products.The app is new to me and I need to work with it but I use my Amazon music on it and just party like it’s 1999 in my bathroom getting ready for work.Get the warranty, which I didn’t but should have because when it decides to not charge you will be sad and anxious for a new one. I have had my 1st one for 5 years, I dropped it, regularly and no problems. I use it in the bathroom next to the sink because it is waterproof.The charging dock I haven’t seen it really charge yet, but I could be doing it wrong. But the cord is easy peasy.I love my boom 3 and will stick with Ultimate ears for years to come. You can pair I think up to 20 with the boom 3.

This one was even worse as it started cutting in and out like the last one, but after only 3 weeks of use. I initiated a return, and hopefully I can get it because I threw the box away after I opened it.

R200IE3MUNI9EU,B07DD3WBYW,5.0 out of 5 stars good size + sound quality,Omar Siddique,5,"Nice clear mids & decent bass, in an attractive device, make this an all-around winner.On the negative side: there's a mostly unnecessary app, oversized volume buttons, and a I'd prefer it had a USB-C power connector instead of the old ""micro"" connector.Over all, this is a great speaker. It also looks really nice, and feels solid in-hand. The UE is small/light enough that I use it as my travel speaker, although I prefer the boom-ier bass on my (heavier) JBL for workout and party music at home.This speaker sounds good, but not obtrusive-- natural for various genres. The default tuning is ""fine"". Unusual for a Bluetooth speaker, there is an EQ feature on the app, but it doesn't let you turn one band up without decreasing the others. Good for tuning the sound quality for eg, spoken podcasts, but you can't turn up the bass or the treble like you might on a usual sound system.The app also allows using the speaker's top ""smart"" button to automatically launch playlists without otherwise interacting with a device. A clever idea, but since I usually use an AI (like Google Assistant) I find it unnnecessary, and better to not have too many random apps installed. The speaker works beautifully without the app-- totally optional.I used to buy Logitech PC speakers long ago, and they still make good ""gaming"" speakers. It's interesting Logi acquired Ultimate Ears, a brand I hadn't heard of before. A good move on their part, as this is one of the two best speakers I tested recently in my search for the perfect hardware.Highly Recommended.","Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2020",AGMITI35DNIHMTUWA6JSEYH43FGQ,True,9,Color: Sunset RedPattern: Speaker

R1KELUR90PO5A3,B07DD3WBYW,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little speaker,Labcoated,5,"I've been putting this speaker through its paces for the last few hours and I'm really impressed. Sound quality, water resistance, and build quality is all there. The app is well designed, pairing is quick and easy, and bluetooth range covers my entire apartment.It's important to understand that you're not gonna get crazy sub bass on this thing, but that's not what they're trying to do here. One thing I really have to hand it to UE for on this speaker is instead of trying to reproduce frequencies in those bottom sub ranges, they have obviously set a hard shelf on the EQ that totally eliminates those frequencies from the mix rather than try to make the small speakers in this unit try for it anyway. A lot of other bluetooth speakers I've heard fail pretty hard at that and you end up with distortion and a lot of muddiness in the low range because of it. The tradeoff is that especially low end music (namely drum and bass, dubstep, 808 heavy hip hop and trap, etc) isn't going to exactly shine on this speaker.What does sound great, though, is just about everything else that doesn't rely on sub bass. Rock, jazz, metal, most hip hop, most electronic, funk, r&b, podcasts, etc all sound really clear and have great dynamics. This speaker is also capable of going extremely loud. I couldn't get it past around 70% volume in my apartment without it being excessive, yet the music sounded totally clear and free of distortion even when I cranked it.Also, I brought it in the shower to test and it got wet without issue and dried off quickly.I just got the speaker so time will tell how reliable it is, but count me as impressed. I'm looking forward to taking this on river floats next summer. Really happy that well made, waterproof electronics are readily available now. That was by far one of the biggest selling points to me after the sound quality.They should have used USB C, that's maybe my biggest gripe, I've never cared for micro USB.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2018",AGVINZPVX6XN7HFBN4XKCKCLOOCA,True,49,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

The sound was good and so was the Bluetooth range and the battery life is really good. It has notification sounds that play really loud but you can turn them off so that's not a big deal until you can't turn them off, or the speaker.6 months in the ""magic"" button got stuck. It was always a little touchy but it worked and I never paid it any mind but once it got stuck, none of the other buttons worked anymore. The volume and power buttons no longer responded because the magic button was constantly being pressed. There is an app and I could turn the power off that way but minutes later the power was back on because the magic button was depressed. It took days for the battery to run down and at certain intervals it would announce that some feature was not available and to check the aps internet connection, really loudly. When the battery finally ran down it started screaming that the battery was low every 30 seconds. i had to stash it out in the garage.I contacted support and they got back to me saying the warranty doesn't cover the stuck magic button because it was damaged, the kicker is I never said the speaker was damaged, only that the button was stuck.Since it was no longer covered I found a tutorial on how to take it apart and found that the screws that hold the switch in place were so tight that the switch didn't have room to release. I loosened the screws and the speaker is back to working like it should except it's no longer waterproof. That sounds like a manufacturing defect to me. I let Logitech support know what I found and we'll see what they have to say.I would have given the speaker 5 stars but the business with support knocks it down a couple notches in my opinion.","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2020",AHRLZLHRJOA3UFOB2ZV5EEI2EO2A,True,2,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

I'm not a snob when it comes to portable speakers, great sound is achieved under controlled circumstances with much better equipment, this is good for what it is!The app is nice, but doesn't add a lot for me, I can get most of the functions it provides elsewhere, except for the battery level, nice to check before heading out for a day or weekend.The only small flaw I've found to date is the lack of being able to answer a phone call with it. I'm torn on how important of a feature that really is, but it feels like they could have added it and still kept their minimal, clean, very simple controls in tact.I'm very happy with this speaker and it's sort of become my go-to, it's beating out a number of very nice options!","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2019",AEFX2A4BHG3TUNVA5QUDPFTZB77Q,True,8,Color: Lagoon BluePattern: Speaker

RDTJ4OJICTP06,B07DD3WBYW,"2.0 out of 5 stars Stopped charging after a month, good sound, bad bluetooth, awkward charge cord",Ammon,2,"The sound was good while it lasted. Issues that may concern potential buyers: 1. My Boom3 stopped charging after about a month. It doesn't come with a power adapter. Their instructions and FAQ say to charge using any USB power adapter. I charged it using a surge protector with built-in USB ports. The tiny white charging indicator light has stopped lighting up. The device can recognize that it's plugged into an outlet, but it won't charge. I can't use the speaker anymore, and when I try to turn it on the voice just says, ""Charging, please wait."" I've tried other plugs and cords, but no luck. I'm just outside the Amazon return window (sucks because I want a refund) so I'll have to check if the company will exchange or credit it under warranty. 2. Was hoping to use it with my PC, but audio keeps cutting out even though speaker is right next to the case. I tried the troubleshooting tips in their FAQ multiple times, followed other user threads and tips, but never got it working well. All other bluetooth products I have (including noise cancelling headphones and testing it with my spouse's JBL speaker) worked fine. I even unpaired and ""forgot"" everything, then reconnected only the the Boom3... still cutting out at regular intervals. This is a pre-built gaming PC and only a few years old, so I really don't think it's the PC's fault. I found numerous people online with similar issues. 3. The cord that comes with this for charging is disappointing. It is micro USB, which means it is awkward to insert. Why not use USB-C on a newer product like this? The cord is solid white, so it looks garish plugged into my black Boom 3. Also, the plug housing is a big square, but the Boom3 charge slot is inside an oval recess - it's very snug and awkward to plug in. Finally, the cord is a flat/ribbon style - it does not want to go where you want it to go.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2022",AF2JAXPNOHN4CQ523YQQWVNAZ5VA,True,2,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

I was just about to return until a Amazon video suggested resetting the device. I believe it was ""push the volume minus button and the power button at the same time."" That did the trick. I installed the phone app and chose the ""more bass"" selection on one of the automatic equalizer selections. The equalizer produced much improved sound quality in my opinion. I got this to pair with my TV, and all I have to do to pair it up after the initial pairing is to push the magic button and it responds instantly. Good product, weather resistant.","Reviewed in the United States October 8, 2022",AHA3EXTPUSK2UMNONPCSYCLWVAZQ,True,9,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

RIM63S708LP9L,B07DD3WBYW,3.0 out of 5 stars Not what they used to be,Ivan T,3,"What happened to UE? They used to have great bluetooth speakers. I just read that they were bought by Altec Lansing which explains the drop in sound quality. I owned a UE Boom 1st model and 2nd model and they were amazing. So of course I would buy this model the 3rd gen. Well I was disappointed. First it is not LOUD like the previous models. Bass is sub par but then again UE wasnt really know for heavy bass. So first, I tried the volume at Max outside to see how it was. It was decent but not loud like the other gens. 2nd issue is u will need to download their app to get the most of the speaker but even the app provides minimal improvements. Battery life is better I will say but aound just isnt what it used to be. I would send it back but I gave away my other 2 gens to friends when I ordered this. Do yourself a favor. Buy a bose link instead because this doesnt do it. And the 360 immersive sound that it claims is definitely missing. Disappointed in this speaker to say the least.","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2022",AHDRTT26OA2NWGHZIQ4XNIKAJDRA,True,6,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker
R35NBQEDPO572,B07DD3WBYW,2.0 out of 5 stars Bluetooth connection continues to randomly cut out.,RSTILL,2,"Bluetooth connection to my Boom 3 speakers is sub-par and unacceptable for something in this price range. I own two identical speakers which were bought at separate times and have the issue with both.The problem is that the Bluetooth connection randomly cuts in & out, similar to a popping. Happening in different environments, with different transmitting devices and also in daisy chain connections which is so bad that I can not use multiple speakers together. The problem is not consistent, I have checked the firmware level in the Boom app and it shows it is up to date. My two speakers experience the issue at all distances from the phone which range from sitting on the device, next to the device and then any distance range until it's to far to maintain connection.The issue comes and goes and has been happening more lately which is driving my dissatisfaction and this review. I really wanted this to be a good purchase so have given multiple chances for them to work at an acceptable level.I do not recommend the Boom 3 to anyone unless you get a serious discount and do not expect consistent sound. I'll definitely try another brand when I get so fed up with these that I just donate them away.Side note, it seems like BT can be spiritic on other speakers too so perhaps it's worth it to just get a speaker that offers a hard connection to avoid the frustrating situations when you want consistent sound over portability.","Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2023",AHDQACXK3VYQ6HYHHKFU3PNQSJBQ,True,0,Color: Ultraviolet PurplePattern: Speaker
R2743WGOYTFFJR,B07DD3WBYW,3.0 out of 5 stars Good until not!,Fred Frazier,3,"Wanted to give high mark 5stars, but unit stop charging after only 3mo. I'm currently going through warranty process with UE now. Went to Amazon with my problem, & they handed me over to UE. After several attempts to do what UE wanted me to do ie Troubleshooting. Now had to take pictures of unit, pdf format order from Amazon. 14 emails back & forth with UE, hopefully they will get back to me with good news. More to come, all in all the UE speakers have great sound.Update, UE finally shipped out a replacement speaker. 1st person from UE dropped the ball, with all the emails back and forth.2nd person from UE handled the situation more swiftly. Got my replacement speaker in less than 4 days after speaking with 2nd rep from UE.All good no problems with replacement speaker.However, I think that some items should be brought from the manufacturer & not here.. I have another UE speaker from Amazon & the battery dies so fast. The speaker isn't even a year old.So moving forward, I will buy with more caution..","Reviewed in the United States October 27, 2022",AEGIBVJ2KHWUMBO7MQHWL6AJBNJA,True,1,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker
