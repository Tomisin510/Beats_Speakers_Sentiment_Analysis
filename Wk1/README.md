# Data Mining


Imagine you're organizing a small birthday party for your friend in college. It’s a big day for them, and you want it to be memorable. So you’ve invited everyone they know - school friends, college friends and extended family. But there is one problem: all the guests at this party don’t know each other at all!
To ensure that everyone can easily interact with each other, and enjoy themselves, you’ve decided to include some party games. You already have a list of games that sound fun, but you’re unsure which ones can be enjoyed equally by everyone attending.


So, what do you do? How do you choose the right games for this party?

Simple. Instead of blindly guessing or relying on your personal preferences, gather information on what your guests prefer and plan accordingly. You can talk directly to people from each group to understand their preferences, or you can explore online to discover their interests. This way, you’ll be certain about which games should be included in the mix.




Similarly, in business, understanding your customers' needs through data gathering is crucial. By analyzing customer feedback, market trends, and consumer behavior, you can tailor your products, services, and marketing strategies effectively. This data-driven approach ensures your business decisions are as well-informed as planning a successful party that delights all attendees.


In this project, I gathered data from Amazon reviews of 12 different products for analysis. 

This hands-on experience was done with the sole purpose of understanding the challenges and best practices of data collection. 

## Here is a quick overview of the steps I followed to gather data for this project:
1. Select Products: Find one Beats product (Speaker) and 11 competitor products with a good number of reviews.
2. Scrape Reviews: Use OxyLabs API to scrape the reviews. by inputting the URLs into the relevant spaces.
3. Save Data: Download the reviews and save them as a CSV file.


Step 1: Finding Products to Review
    My first task was to identify as many products on Amazon with a substantial number of reviews. One of these products should be a Beats product, and the others should be from different brands, acting as competitors to the Beats product. This exercise was to help me understand how to select relevant data sources for your analysis.
        1. Identify Beats Product: I selected a beats product, 'Beats Pill Speaker' because it had lots f reviews (my aim was for at least 100 reviews, More reviews mean more data for my analysis!) on Amazon. I copied the URL from the address bar because it is my gateway to all those reviews.
        2. Identify Competitor Products: I selected 11 competitors wo had similar products like the Beats pill Speaker. I ensured each product had a good number of reviews, copied the URLs of these product pages.
