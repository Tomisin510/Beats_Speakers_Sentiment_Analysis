Probably true if in an enclosed space.Outside, standing in the corner of my backyard about 40+ feet away, the speaker volume is at about 60-70% and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker, and the vocals are clear, the instruments are clear, and there\\u2019s even some punch of the bass. It\\u2019s so much more potent than I expected.I actually bought a second one (the one pictured) so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode, and then these are far better than they have any right to be. The bass shook through the house at about 40% volume, to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day. \\ud83d\\ude02So (for now), I\\u2019m obliging and returning one, but honestly, I don\\u2019t want to. One of these speakers are great. Two make a great portable stereo system.Now for the feature set. Key selling points for me were:1. Durability. It\\u2019s made of steel and silicone, is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust. You can enjoy this in the yard, on your workbench, swimming, shower, etc. I live in high desert, and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn\\u2019t have a single dent or scratch. Which leads me to\\u20262. The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning, so the sound quality was maintained even if it\\u2019s on its back, side, or face down. None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge.3. Unlike other products that I considered, this sounded good right out of the box. Anker (Soundcore) offers some great competition in this segment, but needs the EQ tweaked to shine. They\\u2019re not bad by any means, but I wanted things to just be simple. Power on and go without fuss. Bose delivered that.There are similar products for sure. Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo, but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did.We already covered Soundcore. Tweak with the EQ, save some money, you\\u2019ll likely be happy.These speakers do often go on sale, and I purchased mine used (like new) and refurbished respectively. The \\u201cUsed\\u201d unit was actually brand new from Amazon, broke the seals on the box and everything. Far as I could tell, the speaker just rolled around in someone\\u2019s trunk unopened before returning. The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents, broken seals, and all accessories were obviously also unopened.Refurbished unit came straight from Bose. Also came with all accessories and literature, just a box that was labeled \\u201cRefurbished\\u201d. Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless.I bring this up to encourage you to save some money, reduce some e-waste, and buy secondhand like I did. No judgments if you want to go new of course! But I got 2 speakers, one that was new in reality, essentially $100 off the set, and I didn\\u2019t miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty.$150 is pricey for a speaker, but $103 for a Bose speaker is not. Especially one that can literally go for a swim.Four criticisms I\\u2019d like y\\u2019all to know. First, compression above about 75% volume. Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole. In reality, that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile. No big deal unless you\\u2019re blasting EDM, Hip-Hop, the like. As I said, this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70% was more than enough to fill my backyard.Second criticism is no biggie for me, but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition. I didn\\u2019t want to fuss with an EQ, but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound. Consequentially, the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode (not required).Third criticism is truly a nitpick, but why do I have two apps for my Bose products? Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers? Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app. You could easily knock out criticisms 3-4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app, like my QuietComfort Headphones, and this VERY speaker's big brother, the Soundlink Flex Max, is already there. Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music, with a basic EQ like the others?Fourth, this uses outdated Bluetooth. No big deal. Pairs easily. But don\\u2019t expect to watch movies or game off of this. Latency is too high.Anyhow, enough of that. Go buy one. Or better yet, two. You won\\u2019t be disappointed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"timestamp\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

We liked the first one so much, we bought another to link them together.

We use both to turn our deck into a party, and they're especially great for movie nights outside with the projector. They sound great, and have REALLY good bass for their size. Charge lasts a long time. JBL is a quality brand. Can't recommend highly enough.\",\n          \"Pros: Easy to connect. Battery life is to be seen. Cons: I would have liked a status bar in my phone of the battery status. Simple speakers can do this why not this one ??\",\n          \"I bought this speaker because I wanted a way to listen to music while grilling in my backyard. I had no expectations of it being a \\u201cparty\\u201d speaker or anything of the like.But my goodness. This speaker punched above the weight I expected and what reviewers claim. They say it\\u2019s good for less than 10 people. Probably true if in an enclosed space.Outside, standing in the corner of my backyard about 40+ feet away, the speaker volume is at about 60-70% and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker, and the vocals are clear, the instruments are clear, and there\\u2019s even some punch of the bass. It\\u2019s so much more potent than I expected.I actually bought a second one (the one pictured) so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode, and then these are far better than they have any right to be. The bass shook through the house at about 40% volume, to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day. \\ud83d\\ude02So (for now), I\\u2019m obliging and returning one, but honestly, I don\\u2019t want to. One of these speakers are great. Two make a great portable stereo system.Now for the feature set. Key selling points for me were:1. Durability. It\\u2019s made of steel and silicone, is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust. You can enjoy this in the yard, on your workbench, swimming, shower, etc. I live in high desert, and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn\\u2019t have a single dent or scratch. Which leads me to\\u20262. The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning, so the sound quality was maintained even if it\\u2019s on its back, side, or face down. None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge.3. Unlike other products that I considered, this sounded good right out of the box. Anker (Soundcore) offers some great competition in this segment, but needs the EQ tweaked to shine. They\\u2019re not bad by any means, but I wanted things to just be simple. Power on and go without fuss. Bose delivered that.There are similar products for sure. Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo, but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did.We already covered Soundcore. Tweak with the EQ, save some money, you\\u2019ll likely be happy.These speakers do often go on sale, and I purchased mine used (like new) and refurbished respectively. The \\u201cUsed\\u201d unit was actually brand new from Amazon, broke the seals on the box and everything. Far as I could tell, the speaker just rolled around in someone\\u2019s trunk unopened before returning. The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents, broken seals, and all accessories were obviously also unopened.Refurbished unit came straight from Bose. Also came with all accessories and literature, just a box that was labeled \\u201cRefurbished\\u201d. Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless.I bring this up to encourage you to save some money, reduce some e-waste, and buy secondhand like I did. No judgments if you want to go new of course! But I got 2 speakers, one that was new in reality, essentially $100 off the set, and I didn\\u2019t miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty.$150 is pricey for a speaker, but $103 for a Bose speaker is not. Especially one that can literally go for a swim.Four criticisms I\\u2019d like y\\u2019all to know. First, compression above about 75% volume. Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole. In reality, that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile. No big deal unless you\\u2019re blasting EDM, Hip-Hop, the like. As I said, this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70% was more than enough to fill my backyard.Second criticism is no biggie for me, but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition. I didn\\u2019t want to fuss with an EQ, but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound. Consequentially, the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode (not required).Third criticism is truly a nitpick, but why do I have two apps for my Bose products? Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers? Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app. You could easily knock out criticisms 3-4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app, like my QuietComfort Headphones, and this VERY speaker's big brother, the Soundlink Flex Max, is already there. Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music, with a basic EQ like the others?Fourth, this uses outdated Bluetooth. No big deal. Pairs easily. But don\\u2019t expect to watch movies or game off of this. Latency is too high.Anyhow, enough of that. Go buy one. Or better yet, two. You won\\u2019t be disappointed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"timestamp\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

We use both to turn our deck into a party, and they're especially great for movie nights outside with the projector. They sound great, and have REALLY good bass for their size. Charge lasts a long time. JBL is a quality brand. Can't recommend highly enough.\",\n          \"Pros: Easy to connect. Battery life is to be seen. Cons: I would have liked a status bar in my phone of the battery status. Simple speakers can do this why not this one ??\",\n          \"I bought this speaker because I wanted a way to listen to music while grilling in my backyard. I had no expectations of it being a \\u201cparty\\u201d speaker or anything of the like.But my goodness. This speaker punched above the weight I expected and what reviewers claim. They say it\\u2019s good for less than 10 people. Probably true if in an enclosed space.Outside, standing in the corner of my backyard about 40+ feet away, the speaker volume is at about 60-70% and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker, and the vocals are clear, the instruments are clear, and there\\u2019s even some punch of the bass. It\\u2019s so much more potent than I expected.I actually bought a second one (the one pictured) so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode, and then these are far better than they have any right to be. The bass shook through the house at about 40% volume, to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day. \\ud83d\\ude02So (for now), I\\u2019m obliging and returning one, but honestly, I don\\u2019t want to. One of these speakers are great. Two make a great portable stereo system.Now for the feature set. Key selling points for me were:1. Durability. It\\u2019s made of steel and silicone, is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust. You can enjoy this in the yard, on your workbench, swimming, shower, etc. I live in high desert, and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn\\u2019t have a single dent or scratch. Which leads me to\\u20262. The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning, so the sound quality was maintained even if it\\u2019s on its back, side, or face down. None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge.3. Unlike other products that I considered, this sounded good right out of the box. Anker (Soundcore) offers some great competition in this segment, but needs the EQ tweaked to shine. They\\u2019re not bad by any means, but I wanted things to just be simple. Power on and go without fuss. Bose delivered that.There are similar products for sure. Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo, but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did.We already covered Soundcore. Tweak with the EQ, save some money, you\\u2019ll likely be happy.These speakers do often go on sale, and I purchased mine used (like new) and refurbished respectively. The \\u201cUsed\\u201d unit was actually brand new from Amazon, broke the seals on the box and everything. Far as I could tell, the speaker just rolled around in someone\\u2019s trunk unopened before returning. The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents, broken seals, and all accessories were obviously also unopened.Refurbished unit came straight from Bose. Also came with all accessories and literature, just a box that was labeled \\u201cRefurbished\\u201d. Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless.I bring this up to encourage you to save some money, reduce some e-waste, and buy secondhand like I did. No judgments if you want to go new of course! But I got 2 speakers, one that was new in reality, essentially $100 off the set, and I didn\\u2019t miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty.$150 is pricey for a speaker, but $103 for a Bose speaker is not. Especially one that can literally go for a swim.Four criticisms I\\u2019d like y\\u2019all to know. First, compression above about 75% volume. Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole. In reality, that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile. No big deal unless you\\u2019re blasting EDM, Hip-Hop, the like. As I said, this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70% was more than enough to fill my backyard.Second criticism is no biggie for me, but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition. I didn\\u2019t want to fuss with an EQ, but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound. Consequentially, the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode (not required).Third criticism is truly a nitpick, but why do I have two apps for my Bose products? Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers? Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app. You could easily knock out criticisms 3-4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app, like my QuietComfort Headphones, and this VERY speaker's big brother, the Soundlink Flex Max, is already there. Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music, with a basic EQ like the others?Fourth, this uses outdated Bluetooth. No big deal. Pairs easily. But don\\u2019t expect to watch movies or game off of this. Latency is too high.Anyhow, enough of that. Go buy one. Or better yet, two. You won\\u2019t be disappointed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_verified\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false,\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["rev[rev['is_verified']==False]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"Du3eBASdSQjo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1726262947051,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":20,"user":{"displayName":"Tomisin Obijole","userId":"00958725050794090666"}},"outputId":"8c15438b-aad2-425d-e7e5-c61b76b7df8b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["           review_id  product_id  \\\n","336   R27NSEA4YJAF9R  B0CP7YLJ21   \n","337   R304D3EM1TTVF6  B0CP7YLJ21   \n","338   R11KEMQS5SGT92  B0CP7YLJ21   \n","339   R3MIAOES1GMS8H  B0CP7YLJ21   \n","340    RNXZ88CE7BCZX  B0CP7YLJ21   \n","...              ...         ...   \n","1075  R16YQMK6DBJQBM  B0D4SX9RC6   \n","1076   R2H42JDX6Y37E  B0D4SX9RC6   \n","1077  R3L2A88GOC5G6I  B0D4SX9RC6   \n","1078   R99X2DXJ9IWPM  B0D4SX9RC6   \n","1079  R2AZVHS8KVEN85  B0D4SX9RC6   \n","\n","                                                  title         author  \\\n","336   4.0 out of 5 stars DOSS SoundBox Ultra Bluetoo...

It was mostly charged, but was topped off in 30 minutes with the provided USB C cable. The sound is crisp and clear, and it stays clear all the way to full volume. The bass is ok, but not big. I'm very satisfied with this speaker. It has a micro SD cardbslot in the back to load music. It doesn't really look like an outside speaker, more of an around-the-house speaker.\",\n          \"The speaker, when ordered was listed at $179.99 discounted to $129.00 with an additional $10 off coupon bringing it to $119. This is why I gave it 3 stars, even at $119, you have top name brands providing not as nice looking but better sounding speaker at this price point and I would go with those price points.If it were more reasonably priced, it is a nice looking speaker, good design where it could be easily placed anywhere in the house and look good, fit in with the furniture. The sound is above average, with ok bass and treble and loud enough to be heard across the house or outside while having a BBQ. It's comes with rechargeable battery allowing you to place it where you want or take with you and not worry about having an electrical outlet to plug in. I have not tested the 18 hour battery life. Additional nice features are the 3.5 mm audio jack to plug something in to play, also the USB-A and SD Card slots you can plug in and play from in case you don't want to connect your device (i.e. phone, iPad, tablet, other) to play music.

Tried a couple of tunes right away. Don't Panic by Coldplay sounded great. Some punk songs from NOFX sounded quite muddy. Like I think any average person without a particularly good ear for sound would notice the quality issue.But in reality, I'll mostly use this for stuff like listening to some podcasts or gaming at night before I pass out. Vocals in my fave YouTuber channels sound excellent...arguably even better than my desktop speakers in some ways. Gaming is somewhere between my laptop and desktop speakers, but certainly better than the latter so they serve their purpose as I'm not going to lug around my desktop speakers.For the price should have come with a case, and also a wall charger and USB cord. Comes with none of these.Also a bit of a fingerprint magnet though generally looks and feels sleek.Deducted a star for hit or miss sound quality, and another star for missing features for the price point.EDIT: Apparently supposed to come with a charging cord. The company did contact me separately and send one with an apology credit. Updating to 4 stars. Still think a case should be included for the price, being mindful of the sound quality.\",\n          \"Awesomeness\",\n          \"I expected this to sound pretty good, based on reviews from various places...certainly better than the less-expensive bluetooth speakers I've had. I'm a lifelong musician...been around music of all types most of my life. I am blown away by the fidelity of this speaker. My musical tastes are all over the map. Everything is game, and this speaker handles it all impressively. From Coltrane to the Stones, and everything between.Out of the box, the frequency response is flat. That is by design, to give you a reference point for shaping the sound the way you want. To appreciate the capabilities of this speaker you MUST download the Soundcore app, where you can adjust the EQ to whatever suits you. There are several presets in the app, but the real difference-maker is in the \\\"custom\\\" setting, which gives you 9 bands of EQ to fiddle with. If I had to describe this speaker's performance in one word, that word would be \\\"balanced\\\". If you're into bass-dominant listening (rap/hip-hop), you'll probably be better served by one of the boom-box models. This speaker offers rich, full and natural sound across the frequency spectrum, with plenty of volume as well.Punches well above its weight class. I'll grab another one when they're on sale again to have in other areas of the house.

Tried a couple of tunes right away. Don't Panic by Coldplay sounded great. Some punk songs from NOFX sounded quite muddy. Like I think any average person without a particularly good ear for sound would notice the quality issue.But in reality, I'll mostly use this for stuff like listening to some podcasts or gaming at night before I pass out. Vocals in my fave YouTuber channels sound excellent...arguably even better than my desktop speakers in some ways. Gaming is somewhere between my laptop and desktop speakers, but certainly better than the latter so they serve their purpose as I'm not going to lug around my desktop speakers.For the price should have come with a case, and also a wall charger and USB cord. Comes with none of these.Also a bit of a fingerprint magnet though generally looks and feels sleek.Deducted a star for hit or miss sound quality, and another star for missing features for the price point.EDIT: Apparently supposed to come with a charging cord. The company did contact me separately and send one with an apology credit. Updating to 4 stars. Still think a case should be included for the price, being mindful of the sound quality.\",\n          \"Awesomeness\",\n          \"I expected this to sound pretty good, based on reviews from various places...certainly better than the less-expensive bluetooth speakers I've had. I'm a lifelong musician...been around music of all types most of my life. I am blown away by the fidelity of this speaker. My musical tastes are all over the map. Everything is game, and this speaker handles it all impressively. From Coltrane to the Stones, and everything between.Out of the box, the frequency response is flat. That is by design, to give you a reference point for shaping the sound the way you want. To appreciate the capabilities of this speaker you MUST download the Soundcore app, where you can adjust the EQ to whatever suits you. There are several presets in the app, but the real difference-maker is in the \\\"custom\\\" setting, which gives you 9 bands of EQ to fiddle with. If I had to describe this speaker's performance in one word, that word would be \\\"balanced\\\". If you're into bass-dominant listening (rap/hip-hop), you'll probably be better served by one of the boom-box models. This speaker offers rich, full and natural sound across the frequency spectrum, with plenty of volume as well.Punches well above its weight class. I'll grab another one when they're on sale again to have in other areas of the house.

Only good for a specific need/person.Pros:-Build quality is solid, not rugged, but will serve most home users and be okay at a park or beach- Low volume listening is good; if you will be listening to this at night or with close neighbors, the sound production at lower volumes is enjoyable-Bass was semi-decent, especially at low volumes it stood outCons:- Lights don't sync up with music that great and add a tacky effect to the whole package (there is a button to turn it off thankfully).- Sound was very narrow/directional; speaker only sounds good pointed directly at you- Overwhelming boosted vocals and underwhelming boosted bass at higher volumesI can really only suggest this to those who will be mainly listening in a home or at a desk. Also, if low volume listening is a priority this is probably the best in class for that.Maybe if you have a bedroom/office combo and listen to it on low volumes primarily, it would be a fit for you, otherwise look elsewhere.I compared this side-by-side against the LG PL7 and Anker Soundcore motion+ and this came 2nd out of the three for me (#1 is Anker for the price and overall sound)\",\n          \"The speaker has just completely died on me at first the lights started going out, figured that sucked but it\\u2019s not unusable.

Now when I go to use it today I take it off the charger and it just won\\u2019t turn on at all it\\u2019s completely dead and now I need to buy a new speaker this should\\u2019ve lasted more than a year I\\u2019m pretty disappointed\",\n          \"Wait for a sale because while it sounds good at half volume anything above that starts to immediately diminish the sound quality.
